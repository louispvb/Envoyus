{"title": "DENON AVR-2307CI, 7.1 channel receiver w/ HDMI, XM, iPod, dd/dts-MINT", "price": "259", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Scottsdale", "description": "\n         \nFor sale is my Denon AVR-2307CI, 7.1 Channel A/V home theater receiver with HDMI switching. The receiver is in near MINT condition both mechanically and cosmetically. It would be ideal as the heart of any home theater and/or music HIFI system. The AVR-2307CI incorporates very high power (100 watts per channel RMS) into all 7 channels that can easily power 5 to 7 speakers in a surround sound system. The Denon also has the surround sound technology you need, such as Dolby Pro Logic IIx decoding with Cinema and Music Modes, DTS Extended Surround Discrete 6.1 decoding, DTS Extended Surround Matrix 6.1 decoding, DTS Neo:6 Cinema & Music Surround decoding, Dolby Digital decoding, including Matrix 6.1 decoding. The Denon also has 2nd zone capability! With this important feature, you can be watching a movie in 5.1 surround sound in your main room while you have music playing in another room or the patio....at the same time! As many know, Denon is considered as one of the best in the business. \n \n1) Denon AVR-2307CI, Price is: $259.99 or best reasonable offer \n \nOriginal MSRP of the AVR-2307CI is $799.  \n \nThe unit comes with:   Denon remote control,  AM/FM antennas, set up microphone, and the owners manual. \n \nPlease feel free to contact me at (call/text)  480-269-3eight37 to set up a time to audition the Denon. \n \nDenon's AVR-2307CI delivers a riveting home theater experience every time you turn it on. Armed with plenty of advanced surround processing capabilities and 100 watts per channel of muscular, high-current amplification, this receiver will drive up to seven speakers with power and precision. It's also loaded with features that expand your entertainment options -- including XM Radio and iPod integration -- plus others designed to optimize the sound of your system and streamline video connections.  \n \nHDMI switching and video conversion \nThe '2307CI's advanced digital video capability makes it easy to connect two HDMI-equipped video components and switch between them while maintaining the best possible picture quality for both. If you've got an HDTV with only one HDMI input, you'll really appreciate this handy feature. For even more convenience, analog-to-HDMI video conversion means this receiver can send all of your video sources to your compatible TV using only a single digital cable. And if you don't have a TV with a digital video input, the '2307's component video conversion still provides simplified switching for all your video sources.  \n \nSirius/XM Satellite Radio \nThis receiver also helps you keep pace with changing trends in music listening. Just add an optional Sirius/XM Mini-Tuner package and an Sirius/XM subscription to enjoy instant access to more than 170 digital channels of music, news, talk, and sports. It's even compatible with Sirius/XM's new HD Surround channels, which deliver music in multichannel sound.  \n \niPod/iPhone integration \nPick up an optional Denon ASD-1R control dock, and you can integrate your iPod into your home theater system. Listen to your digital music files through your best speakers and view your song titles, playlists, photos, and video on your TV. The dock even charges your iPod as it plays, and lets you control your player using the receiver's remote.  \n \nEasy, accurate speaker setup \nDenon's Auto Setup and Room EQ Adjust takes the hassle out of speaker configuration. Just plug in the included microphone and place it in your favorite listening seat. The '2307CI then uses a series of test tones to balance speaker levels and fine-tune the delay and equalization settings for each speaker. The result is optimized home theater performance for your specific speakers and room.  \n \nVersatility and convenience \nYou get a multibrand remote with glow-in-the-dark keys for streamlined control of every component in your system, even in low lighting. The '2307CI's icon-based on-screen display puts receiver menus on your TV screen to simplify system setup and navigation. The handy front-panel optical digital input lets you easily connect a compatible game console to experience thrilling digital surround sound with your video games. And dual-room/dual-source capability lets you enjoy home theater in your main room while a housemate listens to music in another room.

Thanks \n \n \nOriginal MSRP: $650 \n \nPioneer ELITE VSX-30, Price is: $269.99 \n \n \nHere is some info pulled of off the web on the VSX-30:  \n \nElite receivers have always represented the utmost commitment to the artist's original vision. Combining audio and video processing technologies found nowhere else in their class with multiple professional-level control options, all Elite receivers possess the capability to elevate your entertainment experience beyond what you've ever expected. And with an eye towards total home theater integration thanks to connectivity with analog, digital, and network sources in addition to maximum audio and video precision, these receivers are your solution for a completely unrivaled home entertainment control center. \n \nThe \"Made for iPhone\" certified VSX-30 effortlessly incorporates your Apple products into your home theater. And with Pioneer's exclusive iControlAV app (downloaded separately via the Apple App Store) your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch is transformed into a full-function remote control. Hardly an entry-level Elite receiver, the VSX-30 supports a host of connectivity options for all your latest high-definition home theater components, plus audio support for two zones. RS-232 support means compatibility with the latest professional home automation systems from control leaders like Crestron and Control. And the VSX-30 brings extensive connectivity for your digital media via Ethernet and a front A/V input, and compatibility with Bluetooth sources (using the optional AS-BT100 adapter, sold separately). \n \nThe Ultimate iPhone Experience--Now In Your Home Theater \n \n\"Made for iPhone\" Certification Provides iPhone Users the Ultimate Integration for their Home Theater \nGet a truly plug-and-play iPhone experience in your home theater. Thanks to the VSX-30's \"Made for iPhone/iPod/iPad\" certification, you can enjoy music with iTunes album art, movies, downloaded TV shows from iTunes, photos, web and more. An included USB/composite video cable makes connecting your iPhone to share your favorite media easy--and your iPhone charges automatically when connected. This included cable also works with most generations of iPod Classic, Nano, and iPod Touch. \n \nShare your videos, and enjoy music with full album information and album art on your TV. Your iPhone device's wireless and network features remain fully functional and music and movies will mute when you receive an incoming call. And you've got lots of control options--use the iPhone directly, or push a single button on the VSX-30's front panel to switch control to the included preset remote and an intuitive, full-color GUI. \n \nPioneer's Free iPhone App Turns Your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch into a Powerful Control Center \nPioneer's iControlAV (a free download from Apple's App Store) gives you total control over your home theater sound. With controls for master and per-zone volume, sound fields, and more, you've got a simple but powerful way to adjust your home theater sound any way you like. \n \nThe iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch device's accelerometer are used to control the balance, bass and dialogue--no confusing sequence of remote buttons to remember, just tilt and maneuver your Apple portable device until the sound is right where you want it. \n \nWhere Maximum Fidelity Meets Connectivity \n \nAccess Your Portable Devices, Internet Radio, and More \nIn addition to connections for all your home theater components, a front USB port lets you connect your digital camera or portable media player to display a slideshow of JPEG photos on your HDTV, or play MP3, WAV, or WMA music files with full ID3 tag and album art support. Elite receivers will display up to 32 album art thumbnails on your TV, and you can scroll through them with the included remote. And your options don't stop with your portable devices. When connected to your home network, the VSX-30 is your portal for thousands of Internet radio stations -- all just a few clicks of the remote away. \n \nFull-Color On-Screen GUI \nThere are more ways to control your Pioneer VSX-30 than just your iPhone. There's a full-color on-screen GUI for use with the included learning remote, so you can make guided adjustments to your home theater sound. Not only that, but all Elite receivers let you connect a USB keyboard so you can rename stations for radio and Internet radio, network settings, and more. \n \nRelease Your Smartphone's Music with the AS-BT100 Bluetooth Adapter (sold separately) \nFor wireless connectivity, add a Pioneer AS-BT100 Bluetooth adapter (sold separately) to release your music from your iPhone, iPad, Blackberry, or Android smartphone as well as other Bluetooth-enabled sources like laptops. It's a plug-and-play solution for listening to your smartphone's digital music library. And Pioneer's exclusive Sound Retriever AIR restores critical audio data that is often removed from compressed audio formats, especially when transferred via Bluetooth. \n \n \nHow Pioneer's Technology Delivers the Ultimate Home Theater Experience \n \nThe Latest HDMI Technology Gets You Ready for 3-D \nAll of Pioneer's latest receivers support the latest HDMI 1.4a specification, meaning that you're not just getting the most out of your existing movies and music, you're preparing for the next generation of 3-D video content with the VSX-30. And with 4 HDMI inputs, you've got more than enough connectivity options for the growing number of high-definition sources available today. \n \n1080p Upscaling from Any Source \nPioneer has long been the leader in video processing and the VSX-30 is no exception. Anchor Bay (VRS) Video Reference Series video processing lets you upscale your picture to digital 1080p from virtually any source, including analog. Additionally, 3D Noise Reduction and a suite of video adjustments ensure you'll get the best picture possible from anything you've got. \n \nTrue-to-Life, High-Definition Audio and New Dolby Pro Logic IIz \nOf course all the latest Pioneer receivers support high-definition audio formats like Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio to give your Blu-ray Disc movies a soundtrack that's true-to-life. But Pioneer adds an extra dimension with support for Dolby Pro Logic IIz across its entire 2010 line of receivers, which adds a \"height\" channel for an exciting new surround sound option. \n \nNear Studio-quality Sound with Advanced MCACC \nPioneer's exclusive Multi-Channel Acoustic Calibration system (MCACC) provides a near studio-quality, multi-channel listening experience that customizes each of the VSX-30's 7.1 sound channels specifically to your listening environment. \nAdditionally, the Auto Level Control feature can equalize volume level differences between tracks playing from a portable audio device or commercials during television programming so the volume can be enjoyed at a consistent level--no more jarring \"blare\" when switching audio sources. \n \nWhere the VSX-30 truly shines is with custom control options. Full custom feature-sets including 2-zone Audio as well as partnerships with 3rd party controllers like Control4, Crestron and AMX ensure compatibility with the latest home automation technologies. \n \nAll of these technologies come together in the VSX-30 to deliver an unprecedented level of control and sophistication for the serious home entertainment enthusiast. \n \n \nClick the link below to see the VSX-30 on the web along with full specifications and nice close up photos: \n \nhttp://www.vanns.com/shop/servlet/item/details/538025484/pioneer-vsx30 \n \nPlease feel free to contact me by call/text at 480-26nine-3837 to set up a time to audition the Pioneer ELITE.

Works flawlessly, great battery and cosmetically in good contrition.  It has a few scuffs here and there and one noticeable scratch on the screen. It is a refurbished phone that I've had for over a year with no issues.  It needs a SIM card and to be activated. I would be more than happy to meet at Verizon to make sure everything gets transferred over properly. This phone works great and is paid off in full. Only reason for selling is going to the iPhone 7.

It's been a great car and I am selling it just to purchase another car. It's been immaculately maintained. I have over $4000 in receipts from Noe Imports in Mesa. Mostly rubber and wear items. I just did the fuel sending unit about 2 months ago for $800. New motor and transmission mounts. All the hoses for the supercharger. New alternator pulley since the alternator had already been replaced. The previous owner had it maintained at Mercedes of Chandler. A new battery 3 months ago, the front 2 tires were replaced this summer with Goodyear Eagle GT's. and not not much before that the rears were new from Discount tire.  \nThere are no rips or tears in the leather. New front brakes about 11k miles ago.  \n \nI also put in close to $2000 in stereo equipment. 7\" JVC KW-V50BT Multimedia receiver. USB & HDMI ports. DVD player. 2 amps both digital. 1-4 channel JL Audio XD400/4 ( still a $400 amp ) and also a Alpine amp for the subs. Still has factory speakers. Bluetooth, Pandora, etc. You can also broadcast your iPhone to the screen and play movies, YouTube, or whatever on the screen.  I do still have the original factory stereo and amp if you don't care about the aftermarket stereo.  \n \nThe rear sunshade doesn't go down ( very common problem ). The motor is out. I purchased one and just never had it put in the car. It's normally a $1200 fix primarily for the shade.  \n \nIt's going to be due for plates in January. I think they were about $65 last year. \n \nI had it checked by Noe imports prior to purchase and they mentioned that there had been some body work on one of the rear corners. I couldn't tell. I have never had any accidents. The rubber around the drivers door is coming off and I priced it for $140 but just haven't done it.  \n \nIt's a well maintained, beautiful car worth seeing/driving. No oil leaks and I have the books and my records. No trades. Serious inquiries only!  \n \nSomeone actually stopped by my house after seeing it in my driveway and was interested in buying it about 7 months ago though I wasn't interested in selling at that time. \n \n**FYI** All Mercedes including used come with roadside assistance. You just need to call a dealer and have it changed.

Tournament attendees may now bring Mobile Devices, such as cell phones and other PDAs (Portable Digital Assistants), on to tournament grounds of the Waste Management Phoenix Open. So as not to interfere with tournament play or disturb golfers or spectators, there are a few guidelines that must be followed: Devices must be set on silent mode at ALL times while on tournament grounds. Devices may be used for calls only in designated areas which will be marked by signage. Devices cannot be used as a camera once play begins on Thursday, February 4th. Devices cannot be used as a video recorder at any time. Devices must not be in sight near the rope-line in teeing areas, on the fairway or near the green. If patrons are not near the rope-line and well away from competitors, texting and emailing is permitted. Tournament personnel will be monitoring device use throughout the tournament grounds. Fans who violate policy will be given two choices: Surrender the mobile device and retrieve it later by presenting a receipt at an area near the main gate when they leave the tournament. Leave the property immediately. NOTE: The Waste Management Phoenix Open has developed a FREE iPhone App. It may be downloaded for free at the iTunes online store. The App features tournament information, live scoring, tee times, news and the ability to send updates in the form of text messages... paliered fatherlands compartmentalizes inconvenience insole kahunas militate duchies dicasts clownishness democratically inclosure dawns geomagnetic hod boston holsteins chunkiest mickle attestors denuclearizing abidance carrion gaggle interruption duckboards crayons migs giveaways ll mandatee blazoning hoppers illusional baldachin crassness manuscripts homicide distressingly compeller feedable garbless addictives improvising fraternizes bursting biographical bougainvillaea miscontinuance monoto    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": "33.643188", "lng": "-111.908305", "postId": "5953977970", "postingUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/tix/5953977970.html", "postDate": "2017-01-10T16:25:22-0700", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "2", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/tix/5953977970.html", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:45:26.137390", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "Brand NEW!! Martin Logan Montis ( RESERVE SERIES with 5 year WARRANTY!", "price": null, "priceUnit": null, "cityName": null, "description": "\n         \nHello everybody,  I have a Brand New set of Martin Logan Montis  ( RESERVE SERIES ) the speakers come with a 5 year warranty and are just Beautiful! The CURRENT list price STARTS at $10,000! I am ONLY asking  $6,900 for the pair. I have all the original boxes, manuals, spikes, dust covers ect. \nI bought the Montis on 12/15/2016 from Precision Audio which is a Reserve level Authorized Martin Logan Dealer. The Montis arrived via Pilot Freight on 12/22/2016 and  I currently have them hooked up to a Mcintosh Mc402 amplifier, This combo is just Magical! I hate to let these AMAZING electrostatic hybrids go but I underestimated the space needed to get  optimal performance from them, I have an awkward living room configuration and having the Montis in the correct and proper locations really limits my entry way through the living room so I rather sell them to someone who can get the full use and performance out of them than rather risk accidental  damage with my room restrictions. \nThe imaging, sonic clarity, and 3d spaciousness is unreal! You can really hear every different instrument used and where they are located with the main vocalist dead center!  \nPlease No Low Ball Offers, ONLY serious buyers with cash in hand will be allowed to Audition them. \nPlease feel free to Call/Text with any questions. \n\n  \n \nDaniel. \n \nMore info on the Montis \n \nhttp://www.martinlogan.com/montis/ \n \n \n \n \nOled,suhd,samsung,led

It provides easy, intuitive operation of basic functions, yet it \nis also highly customizable and capable of linking up to 10 devices such as \nsmartphones, SD cards and MP3 players, giving users more ways of staying \nconnected. It is standard on LT and LTZ models. \nEnhanced connectivity and convenience include a new Text Messaging Alerts \nfeature for smartphone users with Bluetooth profile (M.A.P.), which reads incoming \ntexts through the vehicle's speakers, and Siri Eyes Free for iPhone iOS 6 and iOS 7 \nusers to enhance connectivity and convenience. Each enables voice-controlled \nconnectivity, to help keep phones safely stored and hands on the wheel.  \n \nAdditional standard and available features include: \n Eight-inch-diagonal color touch screen and multiple USB ports \n Enhancements including gesture recognition and natural language voice \nrecognition \n \nDesigned for safety \nMalibu offers a wide range of standard and available safety features in the segment. \nAvailable side blind zone alert and rear cross traffic alert complement the available \nforward collision alert and lane departure warning to enhance Malibu's crashavoidance \ncapability. These advanced, active technologies use radar to help avoid \ncrashes, with visual and audible alerts designed to identify potential threats with \nsufficient warning to give the driver time to react and make changes. They're part \nof the segment's only suite of advanced safety technologies offered on a midlevel \ntrim. \nAdditional contributors to Malibu's safety and peace of mind include 10 standard air \nbags -- and two optional air bags -- and available rear vision camera. The standard \nand available air bags include: \n Dual-stage driver and front passenger air bags (two) \n Pelvic/thorax side-impact air bags for all outboard occupants, front and rear \n(four) \n Driver and passenger knee air bags (two)\u2022 Roof rail air bags with rollover protection (two) \nAvailable second-row head/thorax side-impact air bags (two). \nMalibu also employs systems that enable greater vehicle control, including standard \nStabiliTrak electronic stability control system, all-speed traction control and fourwheel \ndisc brakes with four-channel ABS. \nOnStar is standard. It uses GPS and cellular phone technology to automatically call \nfor help in the event of crash. OnStar service also includes MyLink mobile apps, \nwhich offer vehicle information and OnStar services via the customer's smartphone. \n \nStop/start technology enhances efficiency \n The stop/start feature shuts down the engine in certain driving conditions to \nreduce fuel consumption. Along with other technologies, including direct injection, \nvariable valve lift control and a six-speed automatic transmission, the 2.5L \npowertrain contributes to EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings of 25 mpg in city \ndriving and 36 mpg on the highway. \nThere are no buttons to push or procedures to learn with Malibu's stop/start \nsystem. It automatically shuts down the engine when the car comes to a stop under \ncertain driving conditions, such as a stoplight. The engine automatically restarts \nwhen the driver takes his or her foot off the brake. The system monitors vehicle \nspeed, climate control system operation and other factors to determine whether it \nis efficient to shut off the engine.  \n \nThe 2.5L is SAE-certified at 196 horsepower (146 kW) and 186 lb-ft of torque (252 \nNm). Revised transmission shift points and quicker shifts also enhance the feeling \nof performance -- while delivering greater refinement.

Canon photography print paper and comes loaded with all five color ink cartridges), and if you end up meeting up with me today to buy printer I'll throw in the complete five color ink cartridge refill kit for no extra $. (Total for printer, sample photo paper, and ink refill= $60.00). The printer itself is completely blemish, scratch, and damage free what-so-ever as previously stated and comes with all original packaging, set-up instructions, per-loaded ink cartridges, and extras all in brand new condition except for the fact that they've been opened, set-up, and printed with a dozen times or less. The only reason I'm getting rid of it at all is that I am moving and have started a different type of work-from-home style business, so the printer is unnecessary in my new line of work. I can tell you that this printer is absolutely amazing especially for printing photos and top of the line digital imagery, as well as custom made CD/DVD labels through the use of one of the different paper trays. This printer/copier/fax can also be used with a separate (buyer would have to purchase separately on their own from a place like Amazon and/or Ebay) Canon J ID Card Tray, in order to print your own PVC ID Cards from home. This is useful if buyer is interested in making cheap employee ID Cards for really cheap and from home, or if you need to make a copy of your current employee and/or State ID card for example...can also be used to make your own custom Customer Loyalty Cards for example ie. Frys VIP Cards, Bashas Club Cards, ect. \n \n \n \n \nCOMMAND YOUR OFFICE: \nBring superior quality and many wireless capabilities to your home office with the PIXMA MX922. This printer has built-in WiFi\u00ae1 for printing and scanning virtually anywhere in your home. It also includes AirPrint2, which lets you wirelessly print from your iPad, iPhone or iPod touch devices. \n \nTHIS MEANS BUSINESS: \nFast, effective & efficient. The PIXMA MX922 Office All-in-One Inkjet Printer gives you the ability to print, scan, copy or fax with one machine so you can create a cost-efficient and productive small office. Meet all of your business needs with a variety of intuitive features packed into one dependable, high-performance machine. \n \nPRINTER: \nPrint Speed (up to)\t4\" x 6\" Borderless Photo: Approx. 21 seconds14 \nPrint Speed (Approx)\tBlack: ESAT: 15.0 ipm15 \nColor: ESAT: 10.0 ipm15 \nNumber of Nozzles\tBlack: 1024 \nColor: 4,096 \n \nTotal: 5,120 \nPicoliter Size (color)\t1,2 and 5 \nPrint Resolution (Up to)\tColor:Up to 9600 x 2400 dpi4 \nBlack:Up to 600 x 600 dpi4 \nInk Compatibility\tPGI-255 PGBK XXL XXL Pigment Black \nPGI-250 PGBK XL XL Pigment Black \nCLI-251 C XL XL Cyan \nCLI-251 M XL XL Magenta \nCLI-251 Y XL XL Yellow \nCLI-251 BK XL XL Black \nPGI-250 PGBK Pigment Black \nCLI-251 C Cyan \nCLI-251 M Magenta \nCLI-251 Y Yellow \nCLI-251 BK Black \nPaper Sizes\t4\" x 6\", 5\" x 7\", 8\" x 10\", Letter, Legal, U.S. #10 Envelopes \nAutomatic Sheet Feeder\tADF: 35 Sheets 10 Sheets Photo Paper 5\" x 7\" \nPaper Compatibility\tPlain: Plain Paper, High Resolution Paper; \n \nSuper High Gloss: Photo Paper Pro Platinum; \n \nGlossy: Photo Paper Plus Glossy II, Photo Paper Glossy; \n \nSemi-Gloss: Photo Paper Plus Semi-Gloss; \n \nMatte: Matte Photo Paper; \n \nEnvelope: U.S. #10 Envelope \n \nChlorine-free paper can be used. \nPrinter Features\tAirPrint2, Auto Duplex Print, Auto Sheet Feeder, Borderless Printing5, CD/DVD Printing, Dual Function Panel, Document Printing, Full HD Movie Print8, Google Cloud Print3, Photo Printing, Template Print, Evernote \nOutput Tray Capacity\tLower Cassette: 250 Sheets Plain Paper Upper Cassette: 20 Sheets Photo Paper 4\" x 6\" \n \nCOPIER: \nCopy Speed (up to)\tESAT: Color: 8.4 ipm15 \nReduction / Enlargement\t25% - 400% \nCopy Features\tAuto Duplex Document Feeder, AE (Auto Exposure / Intensity) copy, Auto Duplex Copy, Borderless, Fit-to-Page, Gutter Shadow Correction Copy, Intensity, Multiple Copy: 1-99 pages, Preset Copy, Ratios, Reserve Copy, Sort (ADF), Zoom \n \nSCANNER: \nScanning Element\tContact Image Sensor (CIS) \nMax.

It's an older boat but maintained meticulously.  It has a 9'6\" beam which is the biggest you tow.  It was repowered in 2003 with dual Yamaha F200TXR 4 Stroke outboard engines.  Both engines have 890 + or - 5 hours.  Comes with a Simrad / Lowrance NSS9 Evo 2 Multi Function Display, 4G radar (best radar on the market), Side Scan LSS1 transducer, TM150 Chirp transducer. Simrad Autopilot, and Simrad RS32 VHF Rado that is networked into the system to allow for DSC, dual channel AIS, and GPS.  These are the best electronics on the market.  Comes loaded with Navionics map updated this year and all my fish waypoints.   \nInside the cabin has a sink with fresh water, head or toilet that can double as a shower, a v birth that sleeps 2-3 and a small bunk that fits one comfortably.  Some of the other features are: \n \n \n \nThe bad: \n \n1. Eisenglass on port side is worn and just zip tied to the t-top. \n2. Trailer has a couple center rollers missing.  The boat doesn't need them because it sits on the bunks but adding the two rollers (about $25 for both) would make the trailer complete. \n3. Bottom paint is intact but could use a fresh coat. \n \nThis boat is an offshore fishing machine.  Range is about 300 miles depending on seas.  Can sea trial boat with proof of funds.  The  engines run like a top and never had any problems.  Lower unit oil changed every couple months.  Oil change, thermostats, and oil filters just changed this week.  I wish more then anything I could keep this boat. The engines alone are worth $20k.  $30000 is firm and I will take nothing less. \nIf interested, please call or text me at \n  \n\n\nGreat Grady white sportfish sport fish fishing cruiser trawler cabin cuddy cuddycabin open bow bowrider walk around walk-around cruiser family boat berth birth slip anchor windless mako edge water edgewater Parker raden whaler boston-whaler Boston intrepid tiara pursuit luhrs \n\n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00404_gLYHfYhaoip_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_k7aQVAyFdn9_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_lgq4gZ66vQQ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_3sU9J2aKQmX_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_aEnSK3VeErE_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_dv1CFjaDyKn_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_5PtjAQ2aLAD_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_kmzqrnKv5ty_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01111_ze6xD28iXJ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01010_babPV9poZ61_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_lKHwVUZv1SD_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_aKZtxklpxUY_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_hiCIpQ6Y4cv_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_jVQGQMOU4Pk_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_9HbHPRe2evN_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01616_hdxn5MRpmKy_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_38NCL2eP6y_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00B0B_b7c9OL9QGOo_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_5xOVHpYuWKD_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00707_jQDHct5vkvt_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00505_dsaykonnskf_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_iXcLZeZyzBv_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_cvqBvdKTDx_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01313_5cgTQz03dof_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "32.777700", "lng": "-116.919100", "postId": "5929932118", "postingUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/wvl/boa/5929932118.html", "postDate": "2016-12-22T14:43:44-0700", "updateDate": "2016-12-29T13:09:23-0700", "attributes": "good 895 25 Grady White Sailfish 255 power 1984", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/boa/5929932118", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:46:02.224716", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

Do something about it. \n \nThe photos show a typical Arizona attic with just a couple of inches of insulation and how we brought it up to current standards.  \nThe other photo shows how Thermal Imaging reveals missing insulation.  \n \nElectric Prices are only going one direction and that's UP! They want another 10.9% increase now. By adding insulation, a programmable thermostat, CFL lighting, and doing some simple maintenance you can cut your energy bills by 30% or more. This year do something about it by calling us today for a free quote and beat the SUMMER HEAT! You probably have been CHEATED according to Home Energy Magazine. Most of the attics I have seen in Arizona are severely deficient in insulation, even newer homes, and especially homes with remodeling and additions. http://homeenergy.org/archive/hem.dis.anl.gov/eehem/00/001112.html . Read the article, then have us come out for a free inspection of your attic, complete with a thermal imaging camera.  \n \nA framer, electrician, pest control guy, A/C repair guy, cable / satellite guy, roofer, butcher, baker, and candlestick maker have all been trampling your attic insulation. Even newer homes with the parade of trades doing warranty work have compromised the effectiveness of your insulation. It is common to find bare spots where the wind has blown away your insulation or the original installer short changed you. Call us today and get your home ready for Arizona and a greener electric bill. You will save on your electric as well as providing a more comfortable home.  \n \nYou know there is a problem with your insulation. Do Something About It! Let us provide the materials for you or we can install cheaper than you can buy the materials at the big box stores. If you ask an A/C guy why is your house so hot; he will tell you your air conditioner is undersized, blame it on the builder, and write up a $7,000 fix. He has seen your attic and knows you only have 3-4\" of insulation, but he doesn't make money on insulation. Let us take a look at your attic, if it has enough insulation and it is complete, we will tell you. If it needs work we will provide expert advice and provide you with options to fit your budget.  \n \n \nMost times, the access to the attic blocked by your couch, crib, bowflex, treadmill, bed, air compressor, generator, washer, dryer, recliner, desk, iphone, Picasso, windows, computer, cat, camera, diamond ring, refrigerator, microwave, dining room table, and grandmothers oxygen tank.

She's in excellent condition with No dents on the outside and no rips or tears on the inside. No engine lights on and no recalls due either. Passes emissions, AC blows super cold, no leaks, no weird sounds and of course; has a clean title. Always maintained at a GM dealership and babied its whole life. Just has a recent full system flush and service. I use it only to daily drive with my kids and it's never been abused. You can tell the mint condition right off the bat in person. All 100% done right and professionally. Debuted in 2012 SEMA show for BMS Off-road (Blitzkerg) as their feature. This is a very hard truck to find and a great foundation to continue building upon if wanted.  \n \nIt's set up perfect, as it rides very smooth and quite inside. The suspension was valved appropriately for the weight of the truck and rear end was built to handle the extra rotating mass. Tows a 20'+ Trailer w/two razors with no hesitation too. The engine internals were left un-touched for reliability, as the bolt on performance was professionally tuned in as well.  \n \nI'm sorry but I'm not parting out and/or looking for trades. There way too much to list and explain on this little ad. The iPhone pics don't do this truck any justice, it's a must see in person. My truck is located at my house in Arizona but registered to my other residence in Anchorage, AK. Something has come up financially, so if you're a serious buyer just text/call me at a decent time for more info please. My name is Rocky \n  \n  \n \n*If this AD is still up, it's still available and the VIN is listed on the top right of this ad.*  \n \nHere's some details on the truck; \n \nSuspension / Wheels / Tires: \nBFG Baja T/A Projects 39x13.50/17 Grooved w/Mounted Spare (Balanced w/Equal) (34 psi set for daily driving) \nMethod Racing True 17x9 Beadlocks Machined Finish w/Mounted Spare (Comes w/Center Bore Caps) (Tq'ed @ 24ft lbs.) \nFront: Blitzkrieg Motorsports (BMS) Long Travel Kit Stage 2 w/Boxed Arms & BJ's w/All the BMS Options \nFront: KING Motorsports 8x2.5 Remote Rezzie Coilovers w/Black Anodizing & Valved for Trucks Weight \nFront: KING Motorsports 2.5 Bump Stops w/Limiting Straps \nRear: KING Motorsports 16x2.5 Triple Bypass Coilovers w/Black Anodizing & Valved for Trucks Weight \nRear: KING Motorsports 2.5 Bump Stops w/Limiting Straps \nRear: Deavers Leaf Pack w/BMS Coilover Mounts \nNotes: All Professionally installed & fabbed at BMS HQ.

Do something about it. \n \nThe photos show a typical Arizona attic with just a couple of inches of insulation and how we brought it up to current standards.  \nThe other photo shows how Thermal Imaging reveals missing insulation.  \n \nElectric Prices are only going one direction and that's UP! They want another 10.9% increase now. By adding insulation, a programmable thermostat, CFL lighting, and doing some simple maintenance you can cut your energy bills by 30% or more. This year do something about it by calling us today for a free quote and beat the SUMMER HEAT! You probably have been CHEATED according to Home Energy Magazine. Most of the attics I have seen in Arizona are severely deficient in insulation, even newer homes, and especially homes with remodeling and additions. http://homeenergy.org/archive/hem.dis.anl.gov/eehem/00/001112.html . Read the article, then have us come out for a free inspection of your attic, complete with a thermal imaging camera.  \n \nA framer, electrician, pest control guy, A/C repair guy, cable / satellite guy, roofer, butcher, baker, and candlestick maker have all been trampling your attic insulation. Even newer homes with the parade of trades doing warranty work have compromised the effectiveness of your insulation. It is common to find bare spots where the wind has blown away your insulation or the original installer short changed you. Call us today and get your home ready for Arizona and a greener electric bill. You will save on your electric as well as providing a more comfortable home.  \n \nYou know there is a problem with your insulation. Do Something About It! Let us provide the materials for you or we can install cheaper than you can buy the materials at the big box stores. If you ask an A/C guy why is your house so hot; he will tell you your air conditioner is undersized, blame it on the builder, and write up a $7,000 fix. He has seen your attic and knows you only have 3-4\" of insulation, but he doesn't make money on insulation. Let us take a look at your attic, if it has enough insulation and it is complete, we will tell you. If it needs work we will provide expert advice and provide you with options to fit your budget.  \n \n \nMost times, the access to the attic blocked by your couch, crib, bowflex, treadmill, bed, air compressor, generator, washer, dryer, recliner, desk, iphone, Picasso, windows, computer, cat, camera, diamond ring, refrigerator, microwave, dining room table, and grandmothers oxygen tank. We will very gently help you move any items necessary, but are not responsible for any damage unless it is due to negligence. We cannot help you move your boat, trailer, motorcycle, quads, plasma / lcd / tube TV, bodily fluids, nuclear devices, or land shark dog. All we need to enter the attic is a person and a hose. The machine is often left on the truck street-side or just outside the garage.  \nWe are not a Handy Man service.  \n \n__________________________________________________________________________ \n**Delivery charges for installed materials as follows:  \no Free Basic Delivery to Metro Phoenix, Peoria, Glendale, Paradise Valley, Avondale, Goodyear, Surprise.  \no West Mesa, Chandler, Scottsdale, Ahwatukee, Buckeye, Tempe, and Desert Hills have a $20 fuel surcharge  \no Anthem, East Mesa, Gilbert, Tonopah, Cave Creek, Carefree, Fountain Hills, Wittmann have a $40 fuel surcharge.  \no Maricopa, Apache Junction, Queen Creek, San Tan Valley, Rio Verde, and Wickenburg have a $80 fuel surcharge.  \no All others call.  \n \n__________________________________________________________________________  \n \nSales Representative available 7 days a week, 6am - 9pm \n \n \nEcoSystems America, llc  \nwww.ecosystemsnow.com \n(623) 313-3194  \nLicensed, Bonded, and Insured  \nROC255064  \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_im1axw1eVpI_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_lBbE4XsKk3U_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00606_dl6VXIeJ1pH_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_8n6tAyAmXdm_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "33.509800", "lng": "-112.413500", "postId": "5918868968", "postingUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/mad/5918868968.html", "postDate": "2016-12-14T07:33:51-0700", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/mad/5918868968", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:46:14.443341", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

Do something about it. \n \nThe photos show a typical Arizona attic with just a couple of inches of insulation and how we brought it up to current standards.  \nThe other photo shows how Thermal Imaging reveals missing insulation.  \n \nElectric Prices are only going one direction and that's UP! They want another 10.9% increase now. By adding insulation, a programmable thermostat, CFL lighting, and doing some simple maintenance you can cut your energy bills by 30% or more. This year do something about it by calling us today for a free quote and beat the SUMMER HEAT! You probably have been CHEATED according to Home Energy Magazine. Most of the attics I have seen in Arizona are severely deficient in insulation, even newer homes, and especially homes with remodeling and additions. http://homeenergy.org/archive/hem.dis.anl.gov/eehem/00/001112.html . Read the article, then have us come out for a free inspection of your attic, complete with a thermal imaging camera.  \n \nA framer, electrician, pest control guy, A/C repair guy, cable / satellite guy, roofer, butcher, baker, and candlestick maker have all been trampling your attic insulation. Even newer homes with the parade of trades doing warranty work have compromised the effectiveness of your insulation. It is common to find bare spots where the wind has blown away your insulation or the original installer short changed you. Call us today and get your home ready for Arizona and a greener electric bill. You will save on your electric as well as providing a more comfortable home.  \n \nYou know there is a problem with your insulation. Do Something About It! Let us provide the materials for you or we can install cheaper than you can buy the materials at the big box stores. If you ask an A/C guy why is your house so hot; he will tell you your air conditioner is undersized, blame it on the builder, and write up a $7,000 fix. He has seen your attic and knows you only have 3-4\" of insulation, but he doesn't make money on insulation. Let us take a look at your attic, if it has enough insulation and it is complete, we will tell you. If it needs work we will provide expert advice and provide you with options to fit your budget.  \n \n \nMost times, the access to the attic blocked by your couch, crib, bowflex, treadmill, bed, air compressor, generator, washer, dryer, recliner, desk, iphone, Picasso, windows, computer, cat, camera, diamond ring, refrigerator, microwave, dining room table, and grandmothers oxygen tank. We will very gently help you move any items necessary, but are not responsible for any damage unless it is due to negligence. We cannot help you move your boat, trailer, motorcycle, quads, plasma / lcd / tube TV, bodily fluids, nuclear devices, or land shark dog. All we need to enter the attic is a person and a hose. The machine is often left on the truck street-side or just outside the garage.  \nWe are not a Handy Man service.  \n \n__________________________________________________________________________ \n**Delivery charges for installed materials as follows:  \no Free Basic Delivery to Metro Phoenix, Peoria, Glendale, Paradise Valley, Avondale, Goodyear, Surprise.  \no West Mesa, Chandler, Scottsdale, Ahwatukee, Buckeye, Tempe, and Desert Hills have a $20 fuel surcharge  \no Anthem, East Mesa, Gilbert, Tonopah, Cave Creek, Carefree, Fountain Hills, Wittmann have a $40 fuel surcharge.  \no Maricopa, Apache Junction, Queen Creek, San Tan Valley, Rio Verde, and Wickenburg have a $80 fuel surcharge.  \no All others call.  \n \n__________________________________________________________________________  \n \nSales Representative available 7 days a week, 6am - 9pm \n \n \nEcoSystems America, llc  \nwww.ecosystemsnow.com \n\n  \n \nLicensed, Bonded, and Insured  \nROC255064  \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_im1axw1eVpI_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_lBbE4XsKk3U_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00606_dl6VXIeJ1pH_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_8n6tAyAmXdm_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "33.509800", "lng": "-112.413500", "postId": "5910628250", "postingUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/wvl/mat/5910628250.html", "postDate": "2016-12-08T07:39:44-0700", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/mat/5910628250", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:46:18.406976", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

This year do something about it by calling us today for a free quote and beat the SUMMER HEAT! You probably have been CHEATED according to Home Energy Magazine. Most of the attics I have seen in Arizona are severely deficient in insulation, even newer homes, and especially homes with remodeling and additions. http://homeenergy.org/archive/hem.dis.anl.gov/eehem/00/001112.html . Read the article, then have us come out for a free inspection of your attic, complete with a thermal imaging camera.  \n \nA framer, electrician, pest control guy, A/C repair guy, cable / satellite guy, roofer, butcher, baker, and candlestick maker have all been trampling your attic insulation. Even newer homes with the parade of trades doing warranty work have compromised the effectiveness of your insulation. It is common to find bare spots where the wind has blown away your insulation or the original installer short changed you. Call us today and get your home ready for Arizona and a greener electric bill. You will save on your electric as well as providing a more comfortable home.  \n \nYou know there is a problem with your insulation. Do Something About It! Let us provide the materials for you or we can install cheaper than you can buy the materials at the big box stores. If you ask an A/C guy why is your house so hot; he will tell you your air conditioner is undersized, blame it on the builder, and write up a $7,000 fix. He has seen your attic and knows you only have 3-4\" of insulation, but he doesn't make money on insulation. Let us take a look at your attic, if it has enough insulation and it is complete, we will tell you. If it needs work we will provide expert advice and provide you with options to fit your budget.  \n \n \nMost times, the access to the attic blocked by your couch, crib, bowflex, treadmill, bed, air compressor, generator, washer, dryer, recliner, desk, iphone, Picasso, windows, computer, cat, camera, diamond ring, refrigerator, microwave, dining room table, and grandmothers oxygen tank. We will very gently help you move any items necessary, but are not responsible for any damage unless it is due to negligence. We cannot help you move your boat, trailer, motorcycle, quads, plasma / lcd / tube TV, bodily fluids, nuclear devices, or land shark dog. All we need to enter the attic is a person and a hose.

I made no attempt whatsoever, to hide them! Those photos were only taken to give a serious buyer an idea of what they look like among some common desert shrubbery. *** \n \nI have 12, personally Primed (Ultra-Flat Black) and Camouflaged (Ultra-Flat Sand and Green) 5-gallon Buckets AND Gamma Seal Lids for sale. They are ideal for airtight and watertight situations where you must keep food, tools, large stocks of toilet paper, guns & ammo -- ANYTHING you can get into a 5-gal Bucket -- for safe, dry and airtight keeping at your camping, hunting or BUGOUT spots! \n \nI'm selling my Buckets and Lids as listed below: \n* * * For quantities of 1-5, $25. ea. * * * \n* * * For quantities of 6-10, $22.50 ea. * * *  \n* * * To purchase all 12 Buckets and Lids, $240. ($20. ea) * * * \n \nFor comparison's sake, I've made available, the following two links to Amazon.com's Black Gamma Seal LIDS ONLY -- \"NOT BUCKETS!\" (Although only some of my Buckets came from Home Depot, they happened to be the cheapest Bucket I could find on the Internet for comparison purposes, at about $3. ea, including tax.) \n  \nGamma Seal Lids on Amazon -- Black, 12-pk, $102 (PLUS approx. 7% tax) = $119., or $9. ea. (ADD an additional $3, minimum ea, for the cost of the Bucket/s themselves = $12. per Lid AND Bucket.) \nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00S59JYU0/ref=s9_acsd_hps_bw_c_x_2_w \n \nThe purchase price of one Gamma Seal Lid at-a-time on Amazon is $14.87 (PLUS approx. 7% tax) = almost  $16. ea. (ADD an additional $3, minimum ea, for the cost of the Bucket/s themselves = $19. per Lid AND Bucket.) \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Gamma2-4123-Gamma-Seal-Lid/dp/B0089QJQTS \n__________________________________________ \n \n* * * * Purchasing my entire stock of 12 (one-dozen) professionally Primed and Camouflaged Buckets and Gamma Seal Lids, you'll be paying less than $8 more per Bucket/Lid, than the UNprimed and UNpainted Amazon 12-pk of \"Lids ONLY\" offer above!!! (Did I mention that that's \"LIDS ONLY\" -- NO BUCKETS?) * * * * \n \nIF YOU FEEL MY PROFESSIONALLY HAND-PRIMED and CAMOUFLAGED 5-GAL BUCKETS and GAMMA-SEAL LIDS ARE NOT GREAT BARGAIN, PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING . . . \n___________________________________________ \n \nIf you're in the market for well-primed and painted 5-gal Buckets and Gamma Seal Lids that you're able to store outside and not lose a minute's sleep wondering if they're safely \"hidden\" well enough to be left out in the elements for months (or longer) at-a-time, then look no further!  \n \nIf you're looking for tried-and-true, air and watertight, Professionally Camouflaged Buckets and Gamma Seal Lids that can be easily hidden in \"plain sight,\" today's your VERY lucky day!! (If you had any idea of how much TIME and MONEY I've put into those suckers, you'd understand why I said \". . . today's your 'VERY' lucky day!\") I've used some of these Buckets in the desert over the years -- in a number of diverse situations, elevations and grades, flora, foliage, shrubbery and climates, and they've never let me down!! On a number of occasions, I've even left some of these Buckets \"hidden\" for close to a year in such a perfect way with regards to keeping them out of the sun as much as possible -- AND out of the view of PEOPLE'S WANDERING EYES as they traverse the trail just 25' away. Never once have they ever failed me with regard to being dry inside and watertight, and especially for not ever being discovered by anyone!  \n \nI started out by giving each Bucket and Lid's exterior surfaces a quick, rough sanding by hand with 60-grit sandpaper. Doing so takes off some of the gloss of the plastic, while preparing a much more suitable surface for the Ultra-Flat Black Primer to adhere to. \n \nI also Primed (and painted) the bottoms of each Bucket in the event they get turned over for some reason! I once had a couple of my Buckets turned over and scratched-up a bit by coyotes. (No, they didn't even come close to getting inside the Buckets, nor did they harm them in any way other than having to touch-up the scratch marks.) \n  \nThe next step, Priming each Bucket/Lid with an Ultra-Flat Black Primer, is an important step for several reasons: \n \n1)\tPriming with an Ultra-Flat Black paint prepares the Buckets/Lids for the additional coats of Ultra-Flat paint. The Primer is the 'glue,' if you will, between the Bucket and the upcoming Ultra-Flat topcoats. Even with my heavy-grit sanding of all large surfaces of the Buckets and Lids, I can assure you that the top coats of paint will never stick to the Buckets/Lids without Priming them, first! (I tried. It doesn't work . . . :) \n2)\tPriming the Buckets and Lids act to \"de-gloss\" the Buckets/Lids' glossy finish, thus \"removing\" the Buckets/Lids' glossy exterior finish. From YEARS of desert backpacking, hiking and living experience, I promise you, the first thing that's going to catch the eye of someone you don't want bothering your Buckets, is any sheen, shine or sunny reflection coming from your Buckets -- not necessarily how perfect the final Camouflaged job was! It's that shiny thing gleaming from the never-ending Valley sunlight that someone sees from 50-yards away, and is determined to check it out! Guess what, your site has just been exploited! \n \nPriming with Ultra-Flat Black is one of the most important steps in producing well-Camouflaged Buckets and Lids that you could otherwise only partially camouflage with nearby scrub brush, etc., or only partially bury -- or blend into a mountainous/rocky area. These Buckets are READY TO BE PLACED IN YOUR BUGOUT or \"camping\" AREA RIGHT NOW!! All you have to do is purchase a can or two of the Ultra-Flat final coat/s of paint you'll need to apply (if any) to have them blend into their environment.   \n \n3)\tUltra-Flat Black Primer also gives you the best \"primary\" color there is for the initial covering of the Buckets/Lids. For instance, whatever you don't happen to cover with the natural colors (ALWAYS with Ultra-Flat Camouflage!) of the environment you're placing them, the Ultra-Flat Black will ALWAYS come through as a potential shadow. There is almost nowhere in the untouched desert that doesn't have a wide range and variety of rocks, scrub brush and cactus of all sizes, that all produce shadows at one point or another during the day. Chances are, if you're interested in placing these Buckets and Lids outdoors for any length of time, you'd have a much better chance of them not being discovered if you blended them into some brush, such in the outdoor desert photos I included. Once you do that, that Ultra-Flat Black Primer \"bleeding through\" your top-coats will be very much appreciated! \n \n4)\tAnother advantage of having the Ultra-Flat Black as a primary color is that it can be easily covered in any other ULTRA-FLAT CAMOUFLAGE paint colors ahead of placing them where you want to store/hide them -- incorporating the color/s of the environment you're placing them in -- then, with a can or two of your top-coat colors with you, you can touch-up your Buckets on-site if necessary. It's so simple, and works so well! You can even pull a plant/leaves and holding them up to the Buckets, spray paint over them, leaving a perfectly good reproduction of the vegetation surrounding your Buckets! (Practice on some newspaper, first! But even if you do make mistakes on your Buckets, it's simple and quick to re-paint and start over. \n \nI personally generally used Ultra-Flat \"Sand\" and/or a little Ultra-Flat \"Light Green\" on my Buckets. You can purchase these Ultra-Flat spray paint colors and more at Wal-Mart (cheapest), Ace hardware stores, etc. Wal-Mart is not only the cheapest -- but more importantly -- they almost always have a better selection and stock of the \"Ultra-Flat Camouflage\" spray paint colors, than anywhere else I've shopped. Please understand that IT MUST, MUST, MUST BE AN \"'ULTRA-FLAT' CAMOUFLAGE\" SPRAY PAINT FOR THIS TO WORK; NOTHING ELSE!!!  \n_________________________________________ \n \n****** PLEASE DO NOT GET MY CAMOUFLAGED BUCKETS AND GAMMA-SEAL LIDS CONFUSED WITH THOSE RIDICULOUS, SO-CALLED \"CAMOUFLAGED HUNTER BUCKETS\" or ANY other so-called Camouflaged Buckets you come across -- IF ANY! They're as useless as tits on a bore-hog! WHY? Though, yes, technically, they are \"camouflaged,\" yet the glossy finish of these Buckets renders them, well, \"useless\" - and a huge, dead giveaway to your goods! Can you afford to take that chance?! Again, all it takes is the Arizona sun glaring down on that shiny bucket, and not only could Joe Blow, the hiker see it, but if you happened to be on Federal property, such as - let's say the Tonto National Forest - you could be in a WORLD OF HURT if your local, FRIENDLY Law Enforcement Officer from the U.S. Park Rangers found it!! ;)  \n \nIf you're looking for Buckets you wish to house your heavy supplies in, including tools, food, handguns, ammo, etc., and not to have to haul back-and-forth to your vehicle, house, tent, cabin every day because you're worried they'll be stolen if you don't, these could be your answer. If you're going to leave supplies in your camping, BUGOUT or hunting area for a day or two or longer, my Buckets are the ONLY ones to trust! \n \nThis is one of the few times when \"used\" is a good thing! They're all well-seasoned and battle-tested in real-world situations!! And for this sale, I just finished lightly re-sanding, completely re-Priming with Ultra-Flat Black Primer, and then -- again -- re-coating with Ultra-Flat \"Light Green\" and Ultra-Flat \"Sand.\" That process alone took me 8-hours to accomplish, and cost me over $35.     **** Understand that that $35 is a drop-in-the-bucket (no pun intended:) compared to the amount of money I've invested in these and other Buckets over the past several years, Priming and top-coating most of them a number of times. ****  These extra layers of Ultra-Flat Primer and Ultra-Flat top-coats also add important extra levels of weather and water proofing, as well!  \n \nDespite my best efforts to keep the Buckets' paint from chipping, it is virtually impossible -- especially when they're bouncing around in the back of a pick-up, or even when just carrying to your site if the Buckets are clanking on something hard (such as when carrying two Buckets at the same time in the same hand:). I was aware of this years ago, and quickly learned to always have a half-empty can of Ultra-Flat \"Something\" on hand for minor touch-ups.  \n \nHands-down, however, the main reason the Buckets flake or chip paint, is because THEY'RE ROUND. They don't have just four corners to be concerned about -- the entire Bucket IS A CORNER, per se. If you've ever noticed a piece of furniture, etc., it will always chip or wear-down the finish the most, on all of the corners; the \"hard\" edges -- the same edges and surfaces that will most likely get nicked and scraped when moving around. Now imagine an item such as the Buckets, that have no edges, as the ENTIRE Bucket IS AN EDGE!  \n \nThe bottom line is to not worry about trying to keep them scratch-free when filling and/or transporting them to your camping, hunting or BUGOUT spot. That's why I recommend to always sure to carry a have half-can or so of your dominant color (final coat) OR Flat-Black Primer with you. There are truly only a few places where they'll chip, so it's NOT necessary to carry around several cans of paint to do such little touching-up! \n \nAgain, I'm selling my Buckets and Lids as listed below: \n* * * For quantities of 1-5, $25. ea. * * * \n* * * For quantities of 6-10, $22.50 ea. * * *  \n* * * To purchase all 12 Buckets and Lids, $240. ($20. ea) * * * \n \nJust a heads-up: if you're contemplating going out and buying all of the materials you'd need to properly camouflage some buckets and Gamma Seal Lids in an effort to save money since you now have my tried-and-true method of creating the perfectly camouflaged bucket, give it up. I can tell you without hesitation, that you'll probably spend more per-bucket than what I am selling mine for - even at the \"1-5, $25. ea\" price, before you (maybe) get it right. Not to mention the enormous amount of time you will invest running around looking for exactly the right paints, then getting home (or wherever you don't want LOTS of overspray to come to a rest), and starting to experiment on the buckets and lids. It's expensive, both dollar- and time-wise. Plus, no offense, they won't be quite as effective as mine are. :-) \n \nThanks for taking the time to checkout my Camouflaged Buckets & Gamma Seal Lids!!! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWaterproof buckets, airtight buckets, bugout, prepper, survivalist, supplies, freeze-dried food, Mountain House, 5-gal buckets, surviving, EMP, hunter, hunting, deer, camper, camping, long-term use    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_5iolUPGAmJ2_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00101_4xFdqldIz6u_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_28JL72SSOXv_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_S9ao3bQjH2_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_5lXJOXw7x42_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_2tAs69pAOwT_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_7ISZghfPxLa_600x450.jpg"], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5936707489", "postingUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/cph/for/5936707489.html", "postDate": "2016-12-28T18:04:04-0700", "updateDate": "2017-01-07T09:30:28-0700", "attributes": "excellent Gamma Seal", "locAccuracy": "low", "sellerUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/for/5936707489", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:46:54.973983", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

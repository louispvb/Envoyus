{"title": "Mac&PC Networking KENWOOD Receiver VRS-N8100", "price": "100", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Upper East Side", "description": "\n         \nThis digital control center has barely been used (no time) and is completely new. \nHas multiband Remote for other components and Owners manual. $100 Fixed.-Originally $500 \n   \nCruthchfeild  Reveiw by Barry Montgomery  \nThe ultra-versatile VRS-N8100 is a truly future-friendly receiver -- it not only delivers enveloping surround sound for movies, music, and TV shows, but also provides PC networking capability and a number of special features that video gamers will love. \nTeaming up 100 watts x 6 channels of Kenwood's innovative Pure Path Digital\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00c2\u00a2 amplification and an advanced 32-bit SHARC processor, the 'N8100 surrounds you with cinematic 6.1-channel audio. It also offers enough inputs and outputs to serve as command central for a full A/V system. \nWhat really sets the 'N8100 apart from other home theater receivers, however, is its ability to interface with your PC via a Wi-Fi\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00ae or wired Ethernet network. Navigation screens displayed on your TV make it easy to browse the contents of your hard drive and select audio, video, or still picture files to stream to your home theater system's speakers and TV. There's also a front-panel PC card slot that lets you display photos stored on your digital camera's memory card (adapter not included). \nKenwood designed this receiver with gamers in mind, too. The remote gives you control of Xbox and PlayStation2 systems. The 'N8100's front-panel sports two sets of A/V inputs, one of which is dedicated exclusively to gaming systems (it includes an optical digital input for Dolby\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00ae Digital surround sound when used with compatible gaming systems). Whenever you turn on a game system connected to these dedicated inputs, the 'N8100 automatically switches from the currently selected A/V source to your game and applies the appropriate surround decoding format. Another nice touch is dual-source capability, which lets you play a game and listen to its sound effects through headphones while other housemates enjoy music through your regular speakers. \nProduct Highlights: \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\t100 watts x 6 into 6 ohms at 0.5% THD \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\tDolby Digital EX, DTS-ES\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00ae, Dolby Pro Logic\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00ae IIx, DTS Neo:6, and Dolby Headphone processing \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\t32-bit SHARC processor \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\tstreams audio, video, and still images from your PC via a Wi-Fi or wired network \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\tPC Card (PCMCIA) slot for displaying photos from a memory card (adapter not included) \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\thandles the following file formats: \no\tMP3, WMA, WAV, and Ogg Vorbis audio \no\tMPEG1, MPEG2, and XviD video \no\tJPEG, BMP, GIF, and PNG digital photos \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\tdual-source operation (requires headphones for one source) \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\tautomatic gaming plug & play operation \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\tcomponent video switching: 2 in, 1 out \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\tdigital inputs: 3 optical (including 1 front-panel), 2 coaxial \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\t6 A/V (including 3 S-video and 2 front-panel) inputs \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\tno phono input \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\tEthernet port \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\tmultibrand remote \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\t40 AM/FM presets \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\t1 pair of main speaker outputs \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\t17-5/16\"W x 3-1/8\"H x 15-1/16\"D \n \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_azQPvdB35A8_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_crlDTVy2Fql_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "40.776300", "lng": "-73.952900", "postId": "5919765617", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/ele/5919765617.html", "postDate": "2016-12-14T19:41:34-0500", "updateDate": "2017-01-10T19:36:26-0500", "attributes": "like new", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/ele/5919765617", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:01:36.730241", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

NO HAGGLERS PLEASE \n \nMORE INFO: \nProduct Information \nRetaining the open-world characteristics of Far Cry 2 while returning to an island setting similar to that of the original Far Cry, Ubisoft's shooter Far Cry 3 puts players in control of Jason Brody, a tourist who finds himself stranded on a lawless island where warlords and indigenous rebels have spent years mired in bloody conflict. Gamers can explore the jungles, swamps, mountains, and beaches of the island in a variety of ways, including speeding over land in jeeps, trucks, and ATVs, soaring through the air in hang gliders, and gliding across the water in speedboats. \n \nAs Brody attempts to reconnect with his girlfriend he will interact with a cast of unusual characters, come across more than 20 different species of wild and sometimes dangerous animals, and discover ancient ruins, shipwrecks, and caves. He can also earn money during his adventure by playing poker, racing, and winning shooting and knife-throwing contests. Players gain experience as they fight their way across the island, developing better stealth skills and combat techniques, and collecting plants and animal parts to craft new and improved items. \n \nA separate co-op mode spins an entirely different story, as four crew members of a seedy cruise ship set out on a six-chapter campaign to track down the captain who stole their valuables and sold them out to pirates. Other multiplayer features include classic modes in which gamers team up to capture land or kill the most enemies, while the Firestorm mode finds two teams competing to turn opposing bases into raging infernos. Creative players can also design and share custom multiplayer maps using the included map editor. \n \nkw: xbox one 360 ps4 4 wii U Nintendo DS 3ds farcry 3 xb1 \n \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_os9L2OI5LZ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00000_j01v8cc0PV8_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "40.765100", "lng": "-73.963800", "postId": "5954369113", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/vgm/5954369113.html", "postDate": "2017-01-11T02:31:18-0500", "updateDate": "2017-01-11T02:31:19-0500", "attributes": "new", "locAccuracy": "highest", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/vgm/5954369113", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:01:38.441792", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

RACK ONLY. Includes lat cables which I carefully twisted for convenience. \n \nYou're looking at a Weider Pro 545 Squat/bench/power rack with a lat pulldown cables attachment on both sides of the unit, as seen on picture. Perfect for a starter home gym or someone who doesn't have time to go to a gym and just wants a small roughly 5x5 feet short unit at their house/apartment. This unit allows for practically any line of workout: bench press (please note that bench is NOT included, you'll have to get your own separately, and for the price, it's obvious), biceps via curling, deadlifting, Squatting, Overhead press for shoulders, close grip bench for triceps, rows for lats, and so much more with the assistance of this one compact unit. Its capacity has proven to hold 700LB via its bar holders and the unit also includes safety pins. Its in good condition, some obvious signs of use can be seen as weights were dropped on it but nothing that would in any way hinder its use or cause malfunction, just a few scratches here and there.  \n \nPlease note that this listing is ONLY for the rack. No bench, bar or weights are included with it. And since I do not drive and the unit is heavy, the buyer will have to come to my area in Brooklyn and pick it up. Please be aware of the fact that you'll need a big enough car as the height of the unit is 7 feet and change. I will help disassemble, and load into the car. No original packaging. No PayPal, no shipping, no checks, no BS please. I won't buy whatever bs you're selling so don't even try. Honest buyers only.

HDTVs, the Boxee Box by D-Link, Blu-Ray Players, network storage drives, Xbox 360, Playstation 3, security cameras - power them all, all at once, without annoying glitches or lags. With a PowerLine AV 500 4-Port Gigabit Switch you not only have the freedom to connect your favorite devices anywhere you need them, but also the 500 Mbps speed and advanced QoS optimization to prioritize heavier traffic, and deliver seamless digital entertainment. \n \nCreate a Wall-To-Wall Home Network, Instantly. \nPowerLine technology transmits data along the wiring of a building's existing electrical system, providing a secure and reliable broadband connection to places impossible to reach with a wireless signal. Use your PowerLine AV 500 4-Port Gigabit Switch to extend your PowerLine network and deliver performance up to 500Mbps connectivity exactly where you need it. Just connect your Internet source device to any PowerLine Adapter, plug the PowerLine AV 500 4-Port Gigabit Switch into any electrical outlet, and connect up to 4 high-performance devices to the Switch. Power your entertainment center and keep your home clean and cable-free. PowerLine is the ideal networking solution for homes or small offices where concrete walls, successive floors in multi-storied buildings, or other architectural impediments can significantly weaken wireless coverage and create dead spots. \n \nGet Wireless Freedom and Wired Reliability. \nBecause a PowerLine Network is hard-wired, there is no external 'ambient' interference common to even the most powerful wireless systems. PowerLine network technology is HomePlug AV compliant and works across phases in your building's electrical box to transmit data reliably by intelligently adapting to the strongest signal channels. Data and electricity transmit at very different frequencies, so there's never a problem of electrical interference or shorting with a PowerLine device. \n \nCreate An Ultra-Secure Home Network. \nThe PowerLine AV 500 4-Port Gigabit Switch protects your network with 128-bit AES data security encryption - the same technology used in E-commerce or online banking. Create your own network name and password or put it at the tip of your fingers with 'Push Button Security' standard on every PowerLine device. With hassle-free plug and play installation, and advanced security the PowerLine AV 500 4-Port Gigabit Switch is not only one of the fastest networking solutions available, it's also one of the safest. \n \nGet Ready for the Future - IPV6 Equipped \nWith the growing number of Internet-enabled applications requiring IP addresses, the supply of IP addresses under the current Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) system has already been exhausted. The IPv6 protocol solves this network addressing exhaustion by creating more IP addresses, but migration from IPv4 to IPv6 is not necessarily automatic. No worries - This D-Link product is IPv6 Certified and ready for the future.

Car has t-5 cams, 3\" down pipe to a 2.5\" exhaust, ets intercooler, genuine Saab open intake, 3.5 bar fuel pressure regulator, bilstien b8 shocks, eiback lowering springs.

I've worked on these cars for years and a bad switch will do that. Car comes with a lot of extra parts and stuff, have a full set of snow tires on rims, have 2 front fenders, extra tail lights, abs module, genuine Saab trunk brace. I'm sure I'm forgetting things.

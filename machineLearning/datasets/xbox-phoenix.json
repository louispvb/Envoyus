They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time.

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time.

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time. We fix dozens of these and have a very high success rate. \n \nSERVICES FOR GAME SYSTEM REPAIR,WE FIX PS4,XBOX ONE,PS3,XBOX 360,NINTENDO DS,WE FIX HDMI FOR ANY SYSTEM,IPHONE ,IPAD,MINI IPAD AND MORE,WE HAVE 15 YEARS WORKING WITH COMPUTERS AND SMALL ELECTRONICS WE ARE ARIZONA BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU ACCREDITED,IF YOU NEEDED HELP WITH YOU SYSTEM WE CAN HELP WE DO RE BALLING FOR ANY SYSTEM THANKS, SEE YOU SOON!!! \n \n**Playstation 4** \n \nBLOD,Instant Power Off - 65 \n \nHDMI Port Replacement - 40 \n \nBluetooth Failure - 50 \n \nBD Drive Replacement - 50 to 70 \n \nWLOD (HDMI Scaler chip) - 50 \n \n \n \n**XBOX ONE** \n \nInstant and Random Power off - 65 \n \nHDD Failure/error codes - 30 \n \nBD drive Issues - 50 to 75 \n \n \n \n**PS3** \n \nYLOD,RLOD,No video - 55 \n \nRSOD - 60 \n \nBD Drive not reading games - 40 to 65 \n \n \n \n**Xbox 360** \n \n(PHAT) RROD,E74,E73,No Video - 30 \n \n(PHAT) Open Tray Error - 30 \n \n(SLIM) REOD,No Video,Freezing - 30 \n \n(SLIM) Open Tray Error - 30 \n \n \n \n \nAll repairs come with a 90 Day warranty....\n  \n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": "33.563512", "lng": "-112.117879", "postId": "5950853355", "postingUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/nph/vgd/5950853355.html", "postDate": "2017-01-08T12:54:59-0700", "updateDate": "2017-01-11T16:04:58-0700", "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/vgd/5950853355", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:42:54.372755", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time.

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time.

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time.

By the time we made up (and he let me see the receipts), it was just past the return policy so NONE of it could be returned so I boxed everything up & put it in the closet until now. It is all in perfect looking condition, no scratches or dings etc as everything was kept in our entertainment nook for 10 months & then packed up & put away when he bought the new system. We \"wiped\" the console memory clean (he didn't have much on it to begin with) so it is totally ready to use. Our house is filling up w/stuff & we now have a Toddler (a Daughter who isn't going to play video games) who also has a lot of stuff & we are running out of room so we are selling a bunch of stuff including the original Xbox 360 system & other duplicate accessories & games for the system. None of the below was even used for 12 months when I boxed everything up. \n \n -Included in the original box & details from the box are the following (1st & 2nd pic): \n -Xbox 360 S Console (Black Gloss). \n -250GB Hard Drive (Includes Game & Demos). \n -Xbox 360 Wireless Controller (in perfect condition as we had a blue controller cover on it which we are keeping for the new COD controller). \n -Composite AV Cable (Standard Definition). \n -Xbox 360 Headset. \n -Internal WiFi Capability. \n -Xbox Live; Online Games, Movies, Music & Entertainment Service w/access to Zune, Facebook, Netflix, Twitter, Last.FM & Windows Media Center. \n -Watch your own DVD's as well on this Xbox 360 Console. \n -\"With the largest library of Games and the best in HD Movies & TV, nothing brings people together like Xbox 360!\". \n -All original paperwork/Manual's that came in the original box. \n -All the above cost us $330.00 including tax (1st & 2nd pics). \n \n -Additional Accessories & Games purchased separately but included in this deal are the following (3rd & 4th pics): \n -A second Xbox 360 Wireless Controller (in perfect condition as we had a pink controller cover on it which we are keeping for the new COD controller). \n -A second Xbox 360 Headset (Brand new, never used as it came w/the COD package but he bought a high-tech Headset to use w/the COD Console so we are selling this other Headset). \n -Nyko Xbox 360 S two Controller Charge Base including two rechargeable Batteries (this is another duplicate). \n -High Speed HDMI Cable (this is another duplicate). \n -The following 5 games of which each one is in great condition & have hardly been played/used. I can take pics of the backs if you'd like, I didn't think about it till now. Just let me know. \n 1. Call of Duty, MW3 (Modern Warfare), Rated M. Comes w/all paperwork/Manual. \n 2. EA Sports, NHL10, Rated E. Comes w/all paperwork/Manual. \n 3. Madden, NFL 07, Rated E. (In plain purple case). \n 4. Shaun White, Snowboarding, Limited Edition, Rated T. Comes w/all paperwork/Manual. I honestly think my Husband played this game once, MAYBE twice after we bought it & hasn't touched it since. \n 5. Hulk Hogan's Main Event, Rated T. Comes w/all paperwork/manual. I think he only tried this game once & never touched it again. \n -Everything in this paragraph cost us $320.00 including tax (3rd & 4th pics). \n \n I just took these pictures & put everything back in boxes (the original Xbox 360 box & a brown box) & with that, you have everything needed to plug in the Console & Controller Charging Base & start playing w/two players! Nothing else is needed! We bought everything retail, brand new so we are the original & only owners of everything listed above. Everything is like new as it was hardly played & only by my Husband & once in awhile by myself (no kids or friends etc to damage anything). This is a package deal & a great splurge for yourself/Family or a great gift for your Loved ones since it's in the original Xbox 360 packaging! We paid $650.00 including tax for everything in this ad & may be able to meet you somewhere for your convenience depending on where you are in the Valley versus you driving to our house so knowing these things, please contact me ASAP w/your best offer.

I am posting away from home so I don't have a picture but if interested just text me and I'll send pics. It's in great shape, looks good works perfectly fine. I moved out of town and don't get good internet connections where I live in the country so don't have the same use for it as I did with my online gaming. I am asking $275 for it which I know is a higher price then even a new one.. but considering I have another 250-$400 in games downloaded into it, I feel it's worth it. Includes the brand new Battlefield 1, also Battlefield 4. Other games like Madden 17, EA Access pass that allows free downloads from all EA games, Tom clamcy, UFC, plenty of games and access to more games for free... I will sell it with the profile and software all included. You may not be interested in using a profile I've had, but understand it is linked to EA Access pass, plus all of the achievements and unlocks I have on my games like B4 & B1, so you would be inheriting all games and the unlocks with it. Also included Premium pass for B4 which is another 60-70 dollars. Like I said, I know it's more expensive then what a new one is, but I feel this is fair considering all of the games, access passes, achievements, etc plus the Xbox itself is probably a total value of somewhere between $500-700. More than happy to allow you to hook it up, connect online and see for yourself all the games and unlocks that I have linked to my profile and that it works perfect; I just don't need or want it anymore. Also includes 2 controllers, Xbox One headset & Mic, rechargeable batteries. This is good deal trust me haha..Let me know if interested, I am interested in hearing offers as well.

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time.

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time.

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time. We fix dozens of these and have a very high success rate. \n \nSERVICES FOR GAME SYSTEM REPAIR,WE FIX PS4,XBOX ONE,PS3,XBOX 360,NINTENDO DS,WE FIX HDMI FOR ANY SYSTEM,IPHONE ,IPAD,MINI IPAD AND MORE,WE HAVE 15 YEARS WORKING WITH COMPUTERS AND SMALL ELECTRONICS WE ARE ARIZONA BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU ACCREDITED,IF YOU NEEDED HELP WITH YOU SYSTEM WE CAN HELP WE DO RE BALLING FOR ANY SYSTEM THANKS, SEE YOU SOON!!! \n \n**Playstation 4** \n \nBLOD,Instant Power Off - 65 \n \nHDMI Port Replacement - 40 \n \nBluetooth Failure - 50 \n \nBD Drive Replacement - 50 to 70 \n \nWLOD (HDMI Scaler chip) - 50 \n \n \n \n**XBOX ONE** \n \nInstant and Random Power off - 65 \n \nHDD Failure/error codes - 30 \n \nBD drive Issues - 50 to 75 \n \n \n \n**PS3** \n \nYLOD,RLOD,No video - 55 \n \nRSOD - 60 \n \nBD Drive not reading games - 40 to 65 \n \n \n \n**Xbox 360** \n \n(PHAT) RROD,E74,E73,No Video - 30 \n \n(PHAT) Open Tray Error - 30 \n \n(SLIM) REOD,No Video,Freezing - 30 \n \n(SLIM) Open Tray Error - 30 \n \n \n \n \nAll repairs come with a 90 Day warranty    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5888521976", "postingUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/nph/vgd/5888521976.html", "postDate": "2016-11-22T15:08:41-0700", "updateDate": "2016-12-17T09:59:55-0700", "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "medium", "sellerUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/vgd/5888521976", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:43:56.954148", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time. We fix dozens of these and have a very high success rate. \n \nSERVICES FOR GAME SYSTEM REPAIR,WE FIX PS4,XBOX ONE,PS3,XBOX 360,NINTENDO DS,WE FIX HDMI FOR ANY SYSTEM,IPHONE ,IPAD,MINI IPAD AND MORE,WE HAVE 15 YEARS WORKING WITH COMPUTERS AND SMALL ELECTRONICS WE ARE ARIZONA BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU ACCREDITED,IF YOU NEEDED HELP WITH YOU SYSTEM WE CAN HELP WE DO RE BALLING FOR ANY SYSTEM THANKS, SEE YOU SOON!!! \n \n**Playstation 4** \n \nBLOD,Instant Power Off - 65 \n \nHDMI Port Replacement - 40 \n \nBluetooth Failure - 50 \n \nBD Drive Replacement - 50 \n \nWLOD (HDMI Scaler chip) - 50 \n \n \n \n**XBOX ONE** \n \nInstant and Random Power off - 65 \n \nHDD Failure/error codes - 30 \n \nBD drive Issues - 50 \n \n \n \n**PS3** \n \nYLOD,RLOD,No video - 55 \n \nRSOD - 60 \n \nBD Drive not reading games - 40 to 65 \n \n \n \n**Xbox 360** \n \n(PHAT) RROD,E74,E73,No Video - 30 \n \n(PHAT) Open Tray Error - 30 \n \n(SLIM) REOD,No Video,Freezing - 30 \n \n(SLIM) Open Tray Error - 30 \n \n \n \n \nAll repairs come with a 90 Day warranty    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5882385647", "postingUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/nph/vgd/5882385647.html", "postDate": "2016-11-18T11:23:01-0700", "updateDate": "2016-12-13T18:40:56-0700", "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "medium", "sellerUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/vgd/5882385647", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:44:04.960878", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time.

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time.

{"title": "Brand NEW!! Martin Logan Montis ( RESERVE SERIES with 5 year WARRANTY!", "price": null, "priceUnit": null, "cityName": null, "description": "\n         \nHello everybody,  I have a Brand New set of Martin Logan Montis  ( RESERVE SERIES ) the speakers come with a 5 year warranty and are just Beautiful! The CURRENT list price STARTS at $10,000! I am ONLY asking  $6,900 for the pair. I have all the original boxes, manuals, spikes, dust covers ect. \nI bought the Montis on 12/15/2016 from Precision Audio which is a Reserve level Authorized Martin Logan Dealer. The Montis arrived via Pilot Freight on 12/22/2016 and  I currently have them hooked up to a Mcintosh Mc402 amplifier, This combo is just Magical! I hate to let these AMAZING electrostatic hybrids go but I underestimated the space needed to get  optimal performance from them, I have an awkward living room configuration and having the Montis in the correct and proper locations really limits my entry way through the living room so I rather sell them to someone who can get the full use and performance out of them than rather risk accidental  damage with my room restrictions. \nThe imaging, sonic clarity, and 3d spaciousness is unreal! You can really hear every different instrument used and where they are located with the main vocalist dead center!  \nPlease No Low Ball Offers, ONLY serious buyers with cash in hand will be allowed to Audition them. \nPlease feel free to Call/Text with any questions. \n\n  \n \nDaniel. \n \nMore info on the Montis \n \nhttp://www.martinlogan.com/montis/ \n \n \n \n \nOled,suhd,samsung,led

This is a rare and collectible Texas Land Grant signed by Sam Houston, the Father of Texas. The document is signed 1860, making it a pre-civil war document. The document is framed with a museum quality frame and matts. The display also includes two portraits of Sam Houston as General in the Republic of Texas army. In one portrait, Houston is pictured on Horseback at the Battle of San Jacinto. The other is from a period painting of Houston. The display also includes an elegant brass plaque engraved with the famous Houston quote, \"Texas Has Yet to Learn Submission to Any Oppression, Come From What Source It May\". Sam Houston had a \"common\" signature, and an \"ornate\" signature. This document has his ornate signature. He would sign his name in such a way that it looks like he is singing \"I Am Houston\". That is, in the ornate signature, the \"S\" in sam looks like an \"I\". In any event, it is an ornate and flamboyant signature. This piece is available only for local sale . . . I can not ship this piece. If you have any questions, or would like to see it, let me know. It would make an incredible gift for any Texas History Buff, or anyone looking to dress up an office or study. It is extremely rare, and will definitely be a conversation piece.

We are in the process of moving so if you would like this mattress it is ready for pick up ASAP.

{"title": "Various Items For Sale (Furniture, Electronics, etc)", "price": null, "priceUnit": null, "cityName": null, "description": "\n         \nI have a lot of various items for sale. Including, but not limited to, furniture, electronics (music, video games, music equipment, etc). I have included some pictures, but feel free to contact me for questions/more information.  \n \nThis is not a garage sale. I am still using the items and have them in my home. I realized I have accumulated a lot of stuff and I'm looking to downsize. Thank you. \n \n65\" Mitsubishi DLP t.v. with stand - The lamp just went out on the t.v. a couple of days ago. I might purchase a lamp or two for the t.v., or you can purchase as is. The t.v. works great; I've only replaced the bulb once since I've owned it, which has been for about three years. I believe lamps are about $20-$30 on Amazon. I've had this t.v. in my man cave for many years; it's never let me down. The t.v. comes with the stand pictured. = $250 (I also have another t.v. stand, which will also fit a 65\" t.v. I'll include it for free. It's a little beat up but works, it just might need to be tightened). \n \nTwo sturdy shelves, about 6' tall each. I've had these shelves for years, inside and outside of the home. Each shelve has three drawers and one or two removable shelves. Very sturdy. $30 each or $50 for both. \n \nCouch.  It is currently in our backyard, as we use it when we unwind outside. The \"leather\" on the cushions of the sofa is ripping, however, it is still useful. It'd be perfect for the garage or backyard, it's dark brown in color. = $25. \n \nEntertainment Center - The first picture is of the t.v. stand, the next picture is of the two sides and top piece. The t.v. stand has two door and shelves, as you can see. The two side pieces have various adjustable shelves. The total unit is in good condition. I believe when it is fully assembled, the unit will fit a 55\" t.v. I originally purchased this unit for over $300. I'm asking $150. \n \nCD/Movie stand. I don't know how many cd's the stand holds, but well over 200. I'll also include the smaller black stand, which I used for my cassette tapes. = $15 for both \n \nAmp with 2 speakers. Perfect for the garage or small room; I currently use it in my garage. - $40 \n \nAnother pair of speakers; I currently don't use them. = $15 for both \n \nHP Pavilion Slimline computer. I currently use this in conjunction with the Crate amp in my garage. Everything works great, boots up fast. I might have an extra monitor I can include. = $75 \n \nSmall black and silver fridge. I also had this in my man cave. I don't know the cubic feet, but I could always fit a 24 pack of Budweiser bottles in this baby. I've never had any issues with the fridge. Asking $50. Beer not included. haha Well, maybe for the right price..... \n \nXBox One Elite - I hardly see these sold in stores anymore. It is the limited edition, 1 terabyte XBox One Elite, which includes the Elite Controller, which retails for $150 alone. It includes all the wires, connections, etc. I still have the original box. I'll also throw in another controller. I've never had any issues with the XBox; I still use it to this day. Includes the basic headset, but I'll include a chatpad and 2 rechargeable batteries with charging station. = $300 \n (I also have the original XBox One, 500 gigabyte model. I'll add another controller, asking $150.) \n \nLink: https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-One-1TB-Elite-Console-Bundle/dp/B014PZTAME \n \nSony receiver with Bose speakers and sub woofer. I'm not in a real hurry to get rid of this one, just thought I'd include it. It originally came with an Onkyo receiver, but I think the HDMI Out on the unit went out, but it still works. So I then bought the Sony receiver to use with the Bose speakers and sub. The Sony receiver works great with the Bose products. It includes 4 black cube speakers; as I dropped and broke the fifth one. This baby gets LOUD. It's great for video games and movies. I'm asking $275 for the Sony receiver and Bose speakers and sub. For $300, I'll include the needs-repair Onkyo receiver. \n \nScarface Limited Edition DVD set - I've had this for over 13 years; I've never opened it. I'm asking $10 for it.  \n \n2 bean bag chairs. $20 each, or $35 for both. 'Nuff said. \n \nRock Band 4 for XBox One. Includes the disc, guitar, drums and microphone. The items work great, I'm just looking to clean house. = $100. \n \nShelves, shelves, shelves. I have about 13 of the smaller, 3 ft shelves, and two of the taller, 6 foot shelves. I purchased these from Wal-Mart; the smaller shelves were about $15 each, and the taller ones were $20 something, I think. All the shelves are adjustable. I'm asking $100 for the whole set, if you're interested. If not, $10 each for the smaller ones, $15 each for the taller ones. I've only had these for maybe a few months. They've held my video games, movies, books, Suns memorabilia, pictures, c.d.'s, you name it.  \n \nAnd I have some framed pictures and posters. Asking $2 each. I'm just looking to get rid of them. \n \nI'm selling 2 recliners. I've had them for a few years but they work great. One is dark brown, the other is light brown. $100 each or both for $175. \n \nI have a 65\" Samsung LED t.v. with wall mounting bracket I might be willing to part with. = $350. \n \nI also have a couple of vinyl record players; one usb and one is an old school Panasonic PLL Multiplex Circuit player. I also have some various vinyl records. Let me know if you're interested. \n \nLink: http://www.ebay.com/sch/sis.html?_nkw=PANASONIC+PLL+MULTIPLEX+CIRCUIT+TURNTABNLE+SE+3160D \n \n \nI also have an Akai GX-4000D Reel 2 Reel player, with some old reel tapes. I don't know if this interests you... \n \nLink: http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Akai+Gx-4000d \n \n \nI also have TONS more items, more than I can mention here. If you're looking for something in particular, feel free to contact me. I have custom built wood tables and chairs, recliners, dj sound system, etc. I also have law enforcement equipment. I'm negotiable on everything; I'm just looking to clean house and start over. \n \nOh, and if you're really feeling up for it, I have a DJ setup, a 4100 watt Gemini mixer and 2 speakers, Dell laptop, Samsung monitor, digital turntables and various other items. I purchased it a while back and dj'd a ton of parties. Some minor touch ups are required (felt coming off the sides, the plastic wire hookups on the back of the speakers are cracked) but the system works GREAT. I currently have it hooked up to my computer in my man cave and jam out regularly on it. Includes stands for the 2 speakers, 2 fog machines and strobe/disco lights. Feel free to inquire about it. I originally bought these items for about $4,500 a few years back. = Asking $3,000.00 OBO.  \n \nI have a lot of good stuff. I'm just looking for a good home for everything. Thank you.  \n \nBrandon \n5Two0-4FIVE0-Seven2TwoTwo \n \nFeel free to contact me anytime. \n \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00909_3wfesm9T2fI_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00o0o_1XVeZ0WGwb7_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_iqVZSTNOGKv_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01616_dkjpVI6P0No_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00000_cVnWzrmsf29_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_3j1d8pLPD9p_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_3TOb20steRs_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_fcKaa5Wk6Pz_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01313_ettVsEuwsFM_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_gHDx8aT6qJS_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_h6KZBJfd97G_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_gSxQrNm5g2n_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_j4MqySndhQR_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01616_gKlQYqhaxhF_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_1rpSaaXIROv_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01717_dw8iidN44l8_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_frvFCqRHWun_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_4Rk3mCpX8Fn_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_2vgqtKKe83J_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00303_eCf9ibRZFdk_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_94FR3hAjr6e_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_54aoZ9sZafB_600x450.jpg"], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5897967211", "postingUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/cph/for/5897967211.html", "postDate": "2016-11-29T12:47:49-0700", "updateDate": "2016-12-07T10:22:33-0700", "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "low", "sellerUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/for/5897967211", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:45:20.975471", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there.

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time.

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time.

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time.

This actually looks like the interior of a few VW Westie's I've seen! Made by the Alma Desk Company, this is one piece in a collection of mid century modular and sleek office furniture. I actually found original vintage ads for desk units from Alma, (see pic). Alma furniture is also made in the famous High Point North Carolina, known for quality made American furniture. This piece is in great condition considering it has to be at least 50 years old, with great \"spring\" in the seats and cushions.

Beautiful 1960's Stitcheroo string art survivor about to celebrate it's 50th birthday ! Amazing detailed work, known as Mother, this combines threads in shades of natural browns, burnt orange and ocean blue. The intricate Buscilla pattern was glued onto the back by the artist, so you can see the time and patience it took to create this unique and detailed work. All threads are original and in wonderful shape, nothing missing or loose. If you look over to the left of the fish, you can see an darker green in the felt. This is rather long measuring 44'' x 14'' and works well over a sofa or loveseat. This mid century piece has been treasured for five decades and photos illustrate it's remarkable vintage condition. $200 Each sofa measures 47\" W x 32\" D x 29\" H.

I am selling a brand new, 9 Inch multi-layered memory foam mattress I bought on Amazon. I am selling it because I accidentally ordered the wrong mattress size. Amazon does not refund on mattresses that have been taking out of the box so I have kept it in my living room for a few days now. It is clean, unused and looks great. I love the product so I re-ordered a Queen sized one but I now have an extra twin mattress. I originally bought it for $150 online but only asking for $100. We are in the process of moving so if you would like this mattress it is ready for pick up ASAP. Item description: 43 lbs 75 x 39 x 9 inches Twin bed (frame, box spring, mattress, head board), desk with chair, dresser with mirror, and tall dresser. Good condition.

I found an old Frigidaire ice cream freezer in an old metal building i was tasked with cleaning out. Inside of freezer is clean. Has a crack in one door. The entire cabinet could be repurposed. Compressor and associated parts were on the floor nearby. I'm assuming it needed servicing. Must pick up. Will need pick up truck and help. Short bed would do it. Long bed is ideal. This is a rare and collectible Texas Land Grant signed by Sam Houston, the Father of Texas. The document is signed 1860, making it a pre-civil war document. The document is framed with a museum quality frame and matts. The display also includes two portraits of Sam Houston as General in the Republic of Texas army. In one portrait, Houston is pictured on Horseback at the Battle of San Jacinto. The other is from a period painting of Houston. The display also includes an elegant brass plaque engraved with the famous Houston quote, \"Texas Has Yet to Learn Submission to Any Oppression, Come From What Source It May\". Sam Houston had a \"common\" signature, and an \"ornate\" signature. This document has his ornate signature. He would sign his name in such a way that it looks like he is singing \"I Am Houston\". That is, in the ornate signature, the \"S\" in sam looks like an \"I\". In any event, it is an ornate and flamboyant signature. This piece is available only for local sale . . . I can not ship this piece. If you have any questions, or would like to see it, let me know. It would make an incredible gift for any Texas History Buff, or anyone looking to dress up an office or study. It is extremely rare, and will definitely be a conversation piece. I have been a life long collector of Texas Memorabilia, but my wife and I are moving to Africa, so I must sell everything. \nTv still works, just moving away and need to get rid of stuff.

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time.

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable.

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time.

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time.

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time. We fix dozens of these and have a very high success rate. \n \nSERVICES FOR GAME SYSTEM REPAIR,WE FIX PS4,XBOX ONE,PS3,XBOX 360,NINTENDO DS,WE FIX HDMI FOR ANY SYSTEM,IPHONE ,IPAD,MINI IPAD AND MORE,WE HAVE 15 YEARS WORKING WITH COMPUTERS AND SMALL ELECTRONICS WE ARE ARIZONA BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU ACCREDITED,IF YOU NEEDED HELP WITH YOU SYSTEM WE CAN HELP WE DO RE BALLING FOR ANY SYSTEM THANKS, SEE YOU SOON!!! \n \n**Playstation 4** \n \nBLOD,Instant Power Off - 65 \n \nHDMI Port Replacement - 40 \n \nBluetooth Failure - 50 \n \nBD Drive Replacement - 50 to 70 \n \nWLOD (HDMI Scaler chip) - 50 \n \n \n \n**XBOX ONE** \n \nInstant and Random Power off - 65 \n \nHDD Failure/error codes - 30 \n \nBD drive Issues - 50 to 75 \n \n \n \n**PS3** \n \nYLOD,RLOD,No video - 55 \n \nRSOD - 60 \n \nBD Drive not reading games - 40 to 65 \n \n \n \n**Xbox 360** \n \n(PHAT) RROD,E74,E73,No Video - 30 \n \n(PHAT) Open Tray Error - 30 \n \n(SLIM) REOD,No Video,Freezing - 30 \n \n(SLIM) Open Tray Error - 30 \n \n \n \n \nAll repairs come with a 90 Day warranty    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": "33.563512", "lng": "-112.117879", "postId": "5955376233", "postingUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/nph/vgd/5955376233.html", "postDate": "2017-01-11T16:01:20-0700", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/vgd/5955376233", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:47:48.783454", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

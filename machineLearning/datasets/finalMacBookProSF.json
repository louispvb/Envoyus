They replaced the entire display because the screen was defective AND they replaced the logic board at the same time. \n \nBasically, that turned this into a brand new machine, except for the SSD and a couple very small dings on the corner.

However, if you would prefer OSX 10.12 Sierra, that can be installed once you've agreed to buy it. \n \nAs with all used machines, Sale is Final.

Everything is working perfectly including all ports and peripherals like camera, microphone, bluetooth and keyboard.

(You can see from the photo that the battery has a cycle count of zero! This means it has not been used at all.) \n- Brand new logic board \n- Brand new graphics card, all replaced by Apple just last month (see the AppleCare summary in the last photo for proof). \n \n- The storage is a blazingly fast 256 GB Solid State Drive that I just wiped clean so it's in the same state as a brand new Macbook \n- Anti-glare Hi-res 1680 x 1050 display (the anti-glare screen is an upgrade not found on most Macbooks, and is amazing to have) \n- 4-core 2GHz i7 processor \n- 4GB of DDR3 RAM \n \nAdditional features: \n- Optical CD/DVD drive that reads and writes \n- Integrated SD card slot \n- 2 USB 2.0 ports, Thunderbolt port, Firewire port, Ethernet port, headphone and microphone ports, slot for laptop lock \n- Integrated a/b/g/n Wi-Fi card \n- Running El Capitan, and can be freely upgraded to the newest macOS Sierra \n \nCondition is good but there are some marks on the underside as shown in one of the middle photos. This was caused by abrasive debris inside the fitted laptop case I kept it in. The bottom is the only place where these type of marks appear; elsewhere you'll only find small smudges or scuffs. All the issues are cosmetic and won't affect the sturdiness or longevity of the laptop. The top, in particular, looks good as new, and the inside looks great as well. \n    ","imageUrls":["https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_S3mjUXoVc1_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01515_6QJ1eUOChIM_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_8mWIuA5Bh8e_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00505_aJk0FyKBFEn_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_2d7XytQYi2j_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_hRGQSkjtV71_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_h3zQqOHPWvx_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00h0h_hD2zUJBNjlz_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_5TX5Y0ylcxy_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_gpM3gAo3ynX_600x450.jpg"],"lat":"37.381488","lng":"-122.017754","postId":"5952648035","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/sys/5952648035.html","postDate":"2017-01-09T16:49:29-0800","updateDate":null,"attributes":"good Apple 15\" Macbook Pro","locAccuracy":"highest","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/sys/5952648035","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:46:48.137398","specs":{},"processingStatus":"fresh"}

It also helps prevent fraying or weakening of the cables over time. In addition, the magnetic DC helps guide the plug into the system for a quick and secure connection. \n \nWhen the connection is secure, an LED located at the head of the DC connector lights up; an amber light lets you know that your notebook is charging, while a green light tells you that you have a full charge. An AC cord is provided with the adapter for maximum cord length, while the AC wall adapter (also provided) gives you an even easier and more compact way to travel. \n \nDesigned to be the perfect traveling companion, the adapter has a clever design which allows the DC cable to be wound neatly around itself for easy cable storage. \n \nThis power adapter recharges the lithium polymer battery while the system is off, on, or in sleep mode.

{"title":"2012 15\" MacBook Pro with Retina Display for Sale! Comes with Extras!","price":"700","priceUnit":"$","cityName":"fairfield / vacaville","description":"\n         \nHello Craigslist, \n \nI have a 2012 15\" MacBook Pro for sale. Here's a quick list of the specifications for it: \n \n-MacOSX Sierra  \n-Retina display: 15.4-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit display with IPS technology; 2880-by-1800 resolution at 220 pixels per inch with support for millions of colors \n-2.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz) with 6MB shared L3 cache \n-8GB of 1600MHz DDR3L onboard memory \n-256GB Harddrive \n-Intel HD Graphics 4000 \n-NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M with 1GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching \n-MagSafe 2 power port \n-Two Thunderbolt ports (up to 10 Gbps) \n-Two USB 3 ports (up to 5 Gbps) \n-HDMI port \n-Headphone port \n-SDXC card slot \n-802.11n Wi-Fi wireless networking;3 IEEE 802.11a/b/g compatible \n-Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technology \n-Stereo speakers \n-Dual microphones \n-Full-size backlit keyboard with 78 (U.S.) or 79 (ISO) keys, including 12 function keys and 4 arrow keys (inverted \"T\" arrangement) with ambient light sensor \n-Multi-Touch trackpad for precise cursor control; supports inertial scrolling, pinch, rotate, swipe, three-finger swipe, four-finger swipe, tap, double-tap, and drag capabilities \n \nFor any other questions about the specifications, you can find them at the Apple page here: https://support.apple.com/kb/sp653?locale=en_US \n \nI have always kept the laptop in a hard shell case which will come with it. The hard shell case is a little beat up and due to some dust and other things getting in it, the bottom of the MacBook Pro does have some minor scratches on it. However, the inside and top of the MacBook Pro are perfect and show no signs of wear. I've only ever used the laptop for photography work and have just recently upgraded to a desktop so I'm looking to sell my Macbook Pro.  \n \nThe laptop comes with a brand new charger that was bought very recently for it. I also have the original box and manuals for it too. \n \nI'm asking $700 firm for everything and will not go any lower so please do not ask. I'm also not interested in any trades so again, please don't ask. \n \nI'm actually located in Sacramento, but for anyone coming from the Bay Area, I'm willing to meet in Vacaville, but no farther than that. And we'll meet at a local Starbucks so that you can test the wifi and anything else you'd like on it.  \n \nSo, If you've got $700 cash in hand and are willing to drive to me and meet in person, then please feel free to email me or, preferably, text me at 916-Eight-Three-Three-9530. Thanks and have a nice day!

Keyboard and Trackpad have already been tethered to the Macbook Pro with fresh batteries installed so all you have to do is turn everything on and you are all connected! Being a 2011 model Macbook there is normal wear and tear, and some additional damage on the corner of the exterior body (see pictures). This damage has absolutely no affect on the functionality of the machine, and it is still fast and great to use like all Macbooks are! The Macbook has been freshly wiped (500GB Hard Drive) and is ready for it's next lucky owner to take over. All accessories have NO DAMAGE and are in LIKE NEW condition! This bundle is a great value and will make for a perfect holiday gift for someone special. Please see some more detailed specifications and attached pictures below! \n \n\"The MacBook Pro \"Core i7\" 2.2 15-Inch (Early 2011/Thunderbolt) features a 32 nm \"Sandy Bridge\" 2.2 GHz Intel \"Core i7\" processor (2720QM), with four independent processor \"cores\" on a single silicon chip, a 6 MB shared level 3 cache, 8 GB of 1333 MHz DDR3 SDRAM (PC3-10600) installed in pairs (two 2 GB modules), a 500 GB Serial ATA (5400 RPM) hard drive, an 8X DL \"SuperDrive\", dual graphics processors -- an AMD Radeon HD 6750M with 1 GB of dedicated GDDR5 memory and an Intel HD Graphics 3000 graphics processor that shares 384 MB of memory with the system -- and an integrated FaceTime HD webcam. \n \nThe standard configuration of this model has an LED-backlit 15.4\" widescreen TFT active-matrix \"glossy\" display (1440x900 native resolution), but it also was available via custom configuration with a \"high-resolution glossy\" 1680x1050 display and a \"high-resolution antiglare\" 1680x1050 display for an additional US$100 and US$150, respectively. \n \nConnectivity includes AirPort Extreme (802.11a/b/g/n), Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, Gigabit Ethernet, a Firewire \"800\" port, two USB 2.0 ports, separate audio in and out ports, an SDXC card slot, and a new \"Thunderbolt\" port that is backwards compatible with Mini DisplayPort and, likewise, supports an external display at 2560x1600 and passes an audio signal. Thunderbolt also supports other peripherals that use the Thunderbolt standard which provides up to 10 Gbps of bandwidth in both directions.\" \n \n \nI'm asking for a strict $500 CASH ONLY offer, with the ability to meet me at a nearby public space.

In addition, the magnetic DC helps guide the plug into the system for a quick and secure connection. \nWhen the connection is secure, an LED located at the head of the DC connector will light; an amber light lets you know that your portable is charging, while a green light tells you that you have a full charge. An AC cord is provided with the adapter for maximum cord length, while the AC wall adapter (also provided) gives users an even easier and more compact way to travel. \nDesigned to be the perfect traveling companion, the adapter has a clever design which allows the DC cable to be wound neatly around itself for easy cable storage. \nThis power adapter recharges the lithium polymer battery while the system is off, on, or in sleep mode. It also powers the system if you choose to operate without a battery. \nCompatible with 15- or 17-inch MacBook Pro. \n    ","imageUrls":[],"lat":"37.349200","lng":"-121.953000","postId":"5954229635","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/sys/5954229635.html","postDate":"2017-01-10T19:28:09-0800","updateDate":null,"attributes":"","locAccuracy":"high","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/sys/5954229635","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:47:28.684054","specs":{},"processingStatus":"fresh"}

The only reason I don't want it is because I can't fit all my music on it. I used to DJ so with over 10,000 + songs this laptop isn't quite working for me.

I am willing to take the case off for serious customer, just because taking it on and off can cause some wear (it's a snappy clamshell case). The case and the charger are of course included in this offer and I will be sure to factory reset all the settings, so when you open it for your first time it will be like a brand new laptop. If you are concerned about the condition I am more than happy to meet at a computer repair store (there is one in soquel) and they can check things out. Although I am not sure how much that will cost. I haven't had any major glitches with this laptop and I am one to take very good care of expensive things!

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you. A very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all of you!\n\n    ","imageUrls":[],"lat":null,"lng":null,"postId":"5957304130","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/wad/5957304130.html","postDate":"2017-01-13T04:25:27-0800","updateDate":null,"attributes":"","locAccuracy":"low","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5957304130","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:47:56.423171","specs":{},"processingStatus":"fresh"}

CALL / TEXT: 65O-TWO-9O-TWO-397  TOP CASH PAID\n\n\n\n Hayden Separator Antique Shop A Very Merry CHRISTMAS to You All! 2nd Annual Christmas Present Special With each purchase over $50.00-$99.99 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in red paper. With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you. A very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all of you!\n\n    ","imageUrls":[],"lat":null,"lng":null,"postId":"5953041387","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/wad/5953041387.html","postDate":"2017-01-10T04:42:33-0800","updateDate":"2017-01-13T04:21:59-0800","attributes":"","locAccuracy":"low","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5953041387","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:47:58.916756","specs":{},"processingStatus":"fresh"}

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you.

CALL / TEXT: 65O-TWO-9O-TWO-397  TOP CASH PAIDHayden Separator Antique Shop A Very Merry CHRISTMAS to You All! 2nd Annual Christmas Present Special With each purchase over $50.00-$99.99 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in red paper. With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you. A very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all of you! \n\n    ","imageUrls":[],"lat":null,"lng":null,"postId":"5954399784","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/wad/5954399784.html","postDate":"2017-01-11T01:15:55-0800","updateDate":"2017-01-13T05:06:36-0800","attributes":"","locAccuracy":"low","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5954399784","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:48:00.837026","specs":{},"processingStatus":"fresh"}

Heated, cooled and advertised all under one business, Blue Moon. Most Unique Gifts for Dad or Grand Dads......... I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you. A very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all of you!\n\n    ","imageUrls":[],"lat":null,"lng":null,"postId":"5957305052","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/wad/5957305052.html","postDate":"2017-01-13T04:27:07-0800","updateDate":null,"attributes":"","locAccuracy":"low","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5957305052","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:48:02.004198","specs":{},"processingStatus":"fresh"}

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services.

For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years.

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W. ANY OF MY NEWSPAPERS OR MAGAZINES may be inspected (AT THE COUNTER) after you pay for them. You will clearly see they are complete and authentic \n    ","imageUrls":[],"lat":null,"lng":null,"postId":"5955623987","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/wad/5955623987.html","postDate":"2017-01-11T18:48:48-0800","updateDate":null,"attributes":"","locAccuracy":"low","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5955623987","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:48:07.885746","specs":{},"processingStatus":"fresh"}

Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you.

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W. ANY OF MY NEWSPAPERS OR MAGAZINES may be inspected (AT THE COUNTER) after you pay for them. You will clearly see they are complete and authentic \n    ","imageUrls":[],"lat":null,"lng":null,"postId":"5955416219","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/wad/5955416219.html","postDate":"2017-01-11T15:33:02-0800","updateDate":null,"attributes":"","locAccuracy":"low","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5955416219","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:48:14.074889","specs":{},"processingStatus":"fresh"}

Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services.

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60.

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W. ANY OF MY NEWSPAPERS OR MAGAZINES may be inspected (AT THE COUNTER) after you pay for them. You will clearly see they are complete and authentic \n    ","imageUrls":[],"lat":null,"lng":null,"postId":"5954018096","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/wad/5954018096.html","postDate":"2017-01-10T15:57:42-0800","updateDate":null,"attributes":"","locAccuracy":"low","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5954018096","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:48:23.990183","specs":{},"processingStatus":"fresh"}

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago.

I'm selling my 3-month old DELL Inspiron 17 Inch Laptop.  \n \nIt has a fast Intel i3-4030U processor, with 4.0GB Ram and 500GB memory. It comes with genuine Windows 10 Home installed.

It works as good as new -- everything has been factory reset so it's ready to go in the hands of a new owner! \n \nIt's a beautiful, quick machine.

It comes with a unique serial number which can be entered online with LEGO for a unique certificate of ownership (which you can print yourself) and unlock unique contents for your model. \nAt 1:8 scale this model is huge and the set in the store display is absolutely gorgeous! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nharo mountain bmx racing geared saddle straps handlebars road specialized gmc unknown giant throne purefix cannondale Scott trek bicycle jordan nike ps4 ps3 xbox one 1 jordan 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 gucci true religion hat snapback new era fitted adidas free run apc denim supreme tee shirt hoodie sweater cardigan gucci belt LV fendi Hermes starter teams bulls macbook pro air laptop apple ipod ipad iphone htc droid samsung hdtv led lcd plasma fixie sneakers shoes Tags: iphone 1 2 3 4 4s 5 6 7 8 9 ipad mini macbook pro retina air mac laptop cell phone smartphone shuffle gb 16 32 64 nano white black silver verizon AT&T sprint t-mobile virgin mobile ipod touch itouch touchscreen ps3 ps4 xbox 360 hdtv samsung led lcd jordan jordans nike polo gucci lv belt foamposite foamposites snapback strapback fitted new era hat cap durant kd bulls sharks sj jersey foamposites foams penny's pennys harderway champion warriors curry nba 2k16 sharks Versace fendi    ","imageUrls":[],"lat":null,"lng":null,"postId":"5930540985","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/clt/5930540985.html","postDate":"2016-12-23T06:13:24-0800","updateDate":"2017-01-08T09:52:39-0800","attributes":"","locAccuracy":"medium","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/clt/5930540985","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:49:02.488683","specs":{},"processingStatus":"fresh"}

An AC cord is provided with the adapter for maximum cord length, while the AC wall adapter (also provided) gives you an even easier and more compact way to travel. \nDesigned to be the perfect traveling companion, the adapter has a clever design which allows the DC cable to be wound neatly around itself for easy cable storage. \nThis power adapter recharges the lithium polymer battery while the system is off, on, or in sleep mode.

It also helps prevent fraying or weakening of the cables over time. In addition, the magnetic DC helps guide the plug into the system for a quick and secure connection. \n \nWhen the connection is secure, an LED located at the head of the DC connector lights up; an amber light lets you know that your notebook is charging, while a green light tells you that you have a full charge. An AC cord is provided with the adapter for maximum cord length, while the AC wall adapter (also provided) gives you an even easier and more compact way to travel. \n \nDesigned to be the perfect traveling companion, the adapter has a clever design which allows the DC cable to be wound neatly around itself for easy cable storage. \n \n    ","imageUrls":["https://images.craigslist.org/01111_6BXhpOU8l5o_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_f8JXSYRnrMa_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_4SFmeYYDv25_600x450.jpg"],"lat":"37.766895","lng":"-122.188418","postId":"5956854296","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/sop/5956854296.html","postDate":"2017-01-12T15:48:48-0800","updateDate":null,"attributes":"new Apple 60W MagSafe 2","locAccuracy":"high","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/sop/5956854296","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:49:28.440782","specs":{},"processingStatus":"fresh"}

I purchased it for $1300 in May 2015. The price is $1000 but I really want it gone in the next day or two because I need to pay tuition so I am open to negotiation. Please make your best offer. The computer also comes with a screen protector, surface and trackpad protector and a pink keyboard protector. It also has a pink hard shell protective and a polyutherane sleeve and an extra extension cord because I had to purchase a new apple charger after the first one was damaged and it came with another extension cord. The USB port on the left side does not work well, last year something spilled in my bag and got in there, however the right side works perfectly.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you.

Blue Moon has a few starter spaces perfect for the beginner and a few med/large spaces for those of you with lots of stuff. Come join the best at Blue Moon. Heated, cooled and advertised all under one business, Blue Moon. Most Unique Gifts for Dad or Grand Dads......... I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you.

Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you.

I purchased it for $1300 in May 2015. The price is $1000 but I really want it gone in the next day or two because I need to pay tuition so I am open to negotiation. Please make your best offer. The computer also comes with a screen protector, surface and trackpad protector and a pink keyboard protector. It also has a pink hard shell protective and a polyutherane sleeve and an extra extension cord because I had to purchase a new apple charger after the first one was damaged and it came with another extension cord. The USB port on the left side does not work well, last year something spilled in my bag and got in there, however the right side works perfectly.

I have other computers available that you can view by clicking on the \"more ads by this user\" box and even some that aren't listed on Craigslist yet so feel free to ask if you're looking for something else. I can also do custom orders as well such as installing dual hard drives, making fusion drives, upgrading ram, etc.  \n \n \nThis specific computer has an upgraded quad core Intel i7 processor, upgraded 8 GB of 1333 MHz ram, upgraded AMB Radeon graphics with 1 GB of GDDR5 video memory, a speedy 1,000 GB and a long lasting battery with up to 7 hours of typical use!  \nIt has been gently used with very little cosmetic \"damage\" in the form of a handful of small nicks and very light \"scratches\" on the body due to normal use over the years. You can expect most of the damage to be on the bottom cover as that's abused the most but nothing too bad or out of the ordinary. This is a company computer so it has never been dropped, damaged, or had any liquid spills. Everything is working perfectly such as the keyboard, trackpad, display, camera, USB ports and other peripherals. The battery life is great lasting up to 7 hours and it only has about ~350 cycles which is extremely good considering they're rated out of 1,000 cycles before they begin to deteriorate. You're more than welcome to test everything out before purchasing and I'd be happy to help you make sure everything is in tip top shape.  \n \nMacBook Pro 15\", 2011 \n- 2.2 GHz Intel i7 Processor  \n- 8 GB 1333 MHz RAM \n- 1,000 GB HD \n- 512 MB Intel HD Graphics 3000 \n- 1024 MB AMD Radeon  \n- ~30 Cycles! (Battery is rated for 1,000 cycles before it begins to fail) \n- Includes original Apple charger and extension cord \n \nThis computer also comes with the latest version of macOS Sierra along with $3,000 in new, licensed software such as the full Adobe CS6 Suite which includes 17 fully licensed, working programs like Photoshop CS6, After Effects CS6, Illustrator CS6, Indesign CS6 and more. It also comes with the newest versions of Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro X, Screenflow and Microsoft Office 2016. \n \nI am asking for $600 cash, no credit cards, PayPal, checks, shipping or trades. I can also provide a proof of sale at the time of purchase. \n \nPRICE IS FIRM. \n \nFeel free to call or text me at \n  \nand please tell me which computer you are interested since I have other computers listed as well. I'm located in Hayward but am willing to meet in different areas like Dublin, Union City, Oakland, etc.    ","imageUrls":["https://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_i7eCnkMSLTm_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_c44E8OBGYgo_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_25kPJVTtp24_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00909_fRNQEBFKjb7_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_2Z9mQj1Z87Y_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_gwKG2NCmxkE_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00909_ifV4ypi4VVR_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_6eptW4jTlmx_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_incieWX0KD6_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01111_1GIljGXFdNU_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_kl32XDuWjUz_600x450.jpg"],"lat":"37.836500","lng":"-122.280400","postId":"5955157768","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/sys/5955157768.html","postDate":"2017-01-11T12:32:41-0800","updateDate":null,"attributes":"","locAccuracy":"high","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/sys/5955157768","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:50:10.621684","specs":{},"processingStatus":"fresh"}

The screen is perfect no dead pixels, there are some very minor surface scratches on the underside of the case.  \n \nI love the screen size, great for watch TV in bed or editing video on on the go. It's powerful and quick running programs etc. \n \nUsed to use it to edit video hence the eSATA port (fastest connector at the time) will include an eSATA card for connection to external eSATA drives as it will still edit fast 2k or reduced res 4k. \n \nThe MacBook Pro will be fully erased and with a fresh copy of Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6) you can upgrade to El Capitan OS X 10.11 (the last version it can run) very easily with a quick download. It will power up ready for you to put in your own details as if purchased new. \n \nWill come with charger , eSATA express card and Snow Leopard OS disk. \n \nAny questions just ask.  \n \nNOTE I ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED IT ON THE WAY TO SELL AND  NOW NEEDS A NEW LOGIC BOARD FML!!! I'VE LOWERED THE PRICE TO REFLECT THIS.  \n \nNo damage to the outside from the fall but I took it into apple and they said the logic board will need replacing.

It also only has ~100 battery cycles which is extremely low. I do not use the MacBook much since I use my desktop mainly. I have proof of everything in the pictures. \n \nThe machine is operating perfectly but has small cosmetic blemishes. Any mechanical issue can be taken to Apple's Genius Bar and have it fixed without an issue which this laptop has none.   \n \nIt comes with a matte black case and a genuine charger. \n \nPlease e-mail me and I will quickly get back to you. \nI am looking to go back into Windows, I am open to trades.

Great to take to school, doesn't weigh down the backpack at all. No need to bring a cord for charging because the battery lasts all day long. Speakers are nice a loud. Has a headphone jack for those nice audiophile headphones you just bought. Backlit keyboard so you can surf the web at night and in the dark. Did I mention this thing is thin? It's thinner than a paper notebook you bought for class or work. It's thinner than that and it can hold a billion pages worth of notes.

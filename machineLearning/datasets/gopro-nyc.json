With Smart Control FX, an exclusive Line 6 feature that automatically dials in different effect parameters, you spend more time playing and less time tweaking. Simply find the effect that you want, turn the knob to your desired intensity, and you're done.

SELLING IT FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH.  THE DAMAGE CAN BE FIXED ONLINE FOR ABOUT 700.00 AT MOST IN PARTS AND THEYRE EASY TO PUT ON.  I'VE CHANGED PARTS ON THIS CAR MANY TIMES, WHILE ON INSTAGRAM SHOWING PEOPLE WITH MY PHONE IN MY HAND.  ITS SIMPLE..  IM SELLING IT BECAUSE I HAVE TOO MANY CARS.  A LARGE OBJECT FELL ONTO THE HOOD AND CAUSED THE DAMAGE THAT YOU SEE THERE.  NO DAMAGE TO THE MOTOR OR MECHANICAL PARTS.  BEFORE THE TRANNY CONDUCTOR PLATE STOPPED WORKING IT DROVE LIKE A BRAND NEW CAR FROM 2017, AND THAT CONDUCTOR PLATE PROBLEM WAS THERE FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS, AND THE CAR LASTED THAT LONG BEFORE IT TOTALLY WENT, SO YOU KNOW THIS IS A GOOD CAR.  NO OBD 2 CODES EXCEPT FOR THE CONDUCTOR PLATE (P0700 TRANSMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM). \n \nCLEAN TITLE IM THE SECOND OWNER.  IVE NEVER HIT ANYBODY OR REAR ENDED ANYBODY ETC, THIS CAR HAS NEVER BEEN IN A REPAIR SHOP ALL IT'S LIFE.  CAR FAX IT.  IVE MAINTAINED THIS CAR SINCE IVE OWNED IT ON MY OWN AS PER THE MANUAL.  IM A MECHANIC.  I CAN FIX THE WORK THAT IT NEEDS, BUT ITS SO COLD OUT THAT I'D RATHER NOT.... OR WAIT TILL THE SPRING.   \n \nFIRST 1200.00 TAKES IT.  THERES NO TEST DRIVING THIS CAR. BRING A ODB2 SCANNER AND A STACK OF 100 DOLLAR BILLS.  I WILL EVEN HAVE IT TOWED FOR YOU FREE OF CHARGE ANYWHERE WITHIN 200 MILES, BUT I WILL NOT DRIVE THIS CAR FOR ANYBODY FOR ANY REASON.  ITS 1200 DOLLARS OR MOVE ON.  I'LL TURN THE CAR ON AND MOVE IT BACK AND FORTH FROM ITS PARKING SPACE BUT THATS IT.  NO GAMES, NO WINDOW SHOPPERS.  IM A GEAR HEAD, IM A PRO.  I KNOW THAT YOU CAN FIX THIS CAR EASILY IF YOU HAVE A HEATED INDOOR GARAGE.  IM SELLING IT FOR WHAT ITS WORTH.  FIX THE CONDUCTOR PLATE AND IT WILL RUN LIKE A BRAND NEW CAR.  I DO TOP SPEED 90 EASILY ON THE I87 UPSTATE AND I HAVE RECENT VIDEOS OF THIS. \n \nIT DOES RUN.   \nI USED TO DRIVE IT EVERY DAY FROM NEW YORK CITY TO NORTH NEW JERSEY 1HR EACH WAY. \n \nITS THE SPORT EDITION, WITH THE AMG-LIKE WHEELS AND ROUNDED MIRRORS.  NOT THE STANDARD MODEL.  BLACK WITH GRAY LEATHER INTERIOR.  RARE.  MY INTERIOR IS IN NEAR MINT, CONDITION, BUTTER SOFT AND SPOTLESS, AND SMELLS LIKE A BRAND NEW CAR INSIDE.  I WANT TO KEEP IT, BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO REPAIR IT. \nIT HAS READY TO GO XM RADIO AND NAVIGATION, DVD... THE WORKS. \n \nI DID ALOT OF MECHANICAL WORK ON THIS CAR SO THAT YOU WONT HAVE TO- THE BODY DAMAGE WAS OUT OF MY CONTROL- SO THE PRICE IS FIRM.   \nIF YOU WOULD LIKE TO START PRICE HAGGLING, I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT, I'M NOT TRYING TO HOLD ON TO THE CAR, BUT IF YOU PLAN ON PRICE HAGGLING AND BARGAINING, EXPECT ME TO START TAKING THINGS OFF/OUT OF THE CAR, LIKE THOSE FACTORY UPGRADE SPORT WHEELS, AND THE UPDATED MODERN SATELLITE RADIO SYSTEM.  THAT WIRING ALONE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN IS A 500.00 JOB, SO IM DEFINITELY TAKING THAT WITH ME IF YOU'D LIKE TO PRICE BARGAIN... I'M SELLING THE CAR ITSELF, EVERYTHING ELSE ARE ADDITIONAL GOODIES... THEY COME OFF WITH EACH PRICE REDUCTION.  AGAIN, I DONT WANT TO HOLD ON TO THE CAR, BUT I DID RE-DID THE WHOLE CAR ALMOST ALL OVER AGAIN SO YOU WONT HAVE TO, THERE ARE ABOUT 3 THINGS LEFT THAT KEEP IT FROM BEING A STRAIGHT OUT THE DEALER CONDITION CAR (EXCLUDING THE CAR ACCIDENT DAMAGE), SO YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE... I SET THE PRICE AT 1000, IF YOU WANT TO COME DOWN, ADDED BONUSES ALSO COME DOWN OFF THE CAR.  LOOK AT IT THAT WAY, AND KEEP THAT IN MIND. \n \nALL ELECTRICS WORK IN THE CAR EXCEPT FOR THE FOG LIGHTS, AND THE DASH MODE LIGHTBULB IS DIM (THE ONE THAT SHOWS ALL THE FEATURES AND TRIP DISTANCE ETC, THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE). ALL WINDOWS, SUNROOF, AIR CONDITIONING, EVERYTHING WORKS.  I JUST BOUGHT A REPLACEMENT DRIVE SHAFT SUPPORT TO UPDATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CAR, JUST BEFORE IT HAD BEEN DAMAGED. NO MECHANICAL OR ELECTRICAL DAMAGE. ONLY BODY. LIGHTS STILL WORK AND WERE NOT TOUCHED. The light HOUSING/BRACKET though, has been cracked. \n \nIT NOW NEEDS: \n1) a new hood (entire hood) 150-350 on eBay, 277 online (from automotix dot net) \n2) a new grille (although not really damaged, has a non-visible crack in the black part under the silver lines, and should be replaced if you're a perfectionist) \n3) a new light bracket (it's a gray plastic frame unit that holds the light unit to the bumper) - They sell BRAND NEW aftermarket 2016 upgrade versions that include the lights too, on ebay for 150. \n4) the bracket that holds the radiator was pushed back a bit, but no mechanical or electrical parts were affected. \n5) there is light damage to the passenger side fender, (125-175 on eBay) which I had JUST replaced, new) by the very front where the lights are bordered by the fender. I got hit in the back too, so the back rear light is cracked. An original Mercedes Benz used one on eBay right now sells for around 45.00. There are three up for sale right now. Local New Jersey Ebay sellers have the hood too, for 250.00... 277 online free shipping.  The bumper I haven't searched for. The fender sells for around 125. I bought one recently for 125. \n \nBook value for the car the way it was before the damage is 3391 even WITH all those miles I've put on.  Mercedes hold their value.  I've added a photo of the Blue Book quote.  To repair, I find the parts on eBay for cheap all the time and I usually do my own work, but this car will never be the same car to me. I'm the second owner and it was meticulously maintained and pampered. It came from a Mercedes Benz family dealer owned household in New Jersey before I bought it.  All papers and service work and original owner service papers and receipts are in my possession.

Has a flat rear tire but runs and has compression. Needs a quick tune up. Worth about 3k, I'd sell today for 2k or trade for that value. I also have a Motomarina scooter I'd let go for about $800, needs a tank but has compression and should run fine with a tank. \n \nI also have a super clean vintage BMX bike I used to race with the ABA professionally in the 90's worth about 700. \n \nMEMORABILIA: \nLastly, I am selling off an insane collection of unbelievable rock n roll memorabilia I collected while working in top tier studios with the artists you'd have to see to believe. ALL is for sale.

Tons of other stuff too, quite an eclectic collection of one of a kind museum quality items all left behind from sessions I worked on here in Manhattan, AZ, Chicago, LA and Nashville. \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00000_8ZuGaZAleFr_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_iuTYQJBXe4t_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01313_dywe5qgEKkW_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_aOhMADDjJM2_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_2NLOGck3Vor_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_h6NviJHMlKL_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_lr87swaW2QQ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00909_2WBWXmOF4Fz_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_elkqogn5p5W_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_d8YxHdb0xc8_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_l69a0JRS3LE_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_jSpizDElWkk_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00707_9i6SLfclJ90_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_85fDP4591kw_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00000_CQIkaYrnqN_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_cRHnVXSjV3y_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01212_jhmx9aP1tiK_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_juzvUjB4Kwo_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_9OdCZkZIs0Q_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_hisQ52OnZse_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01414_fPPpGsv2LwR_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00707_k6oMOwLx4k0_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_h0MwQpzJulC_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_5NrG7uFZhbF_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "40.717300", "lng": "-73.879200", "postId": "5957442936", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/msg/5957442936.html", "postDate": "2017-01-13T09:54:07-0500", "updateDate": "2017-01-13T10:23:08-0500", "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/msg/5957442936", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:05:29.987089", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "Nissan Skyine R32 GTS-T Sedan", "price": "13000", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "west babylon", "description": "\n         \nHey everyone, I guess you can say the time has come to sell my car. I don't need to sell it but I've had my fun with it by sharing it with my friends and just giving back to the community maybe changing some young kids life by seeing it. You know the good stuff like that, I bought the car late April of 2015 while it was still over seas. Before that the car wasn't advertised anywhere, it was bought from a private seller. The car was bone stock with absolutely nothing done to it, probably just somebodies family car or commuter. Upon arrival, the dealer i bought it from wasn't too happy with how the 25 year old paint job looked so he actually got the whole car painted. Its not a 10k paint job but it's a very presentable paint job, as well he replaced the front seats due to the bolsters being torn. So the front seats are actually out of an R34 GTT. On to the modifications that i did to the car, nothing outrageous or anything. Just your typical HKS intake and blow of valve. A full stainless steel turbo back exhaust, 3 inch straight pipe with a muffler only. Really sounds amazing and very throaty, I have some stage one pro performance coilovers on there that really honestly been a dream of a ride. There's a set of WORK EQUIP wheels on the car, 17x8 and 17x9 +40 with an inch bolt on spacers in the front and a 5mm slip on spacers in the rear. Wheels are wrapped in HANKOOK ventus v12 evo 2, 225 front and 235 rear. On for the interior i have a BOSS Steering wheel adapter with a MOMO mod 08, great wheel. Also installed a fun little boost gauge in the driver side heater duct, looks cool I think. Other than that is a PIONEER double din radio I installed because the factory SONY cd player was inoperable and the stock radio only tunes up to 90fm. Earlier this year i replaced the dashboard. Recently I replaced both rear lower control arms and the gasket from the exhaust manifold to the hot side of the turbo. Oil changes have only been done with Liqui moly, All OEM Nissan parts, thats pretty much it, car drives and runs like a dream with about 117km which is about 72k miles. I'd drive it across country and back having a blast with absolutely no worry in the world for real. Literally the best car I've owned being reliable. I obviously have all the parts and accessories that i took off the car, wheels suspension etc.... Sorry for such a long description but I just wanted to be all clear with everyone. Price is 13k firm, clean title in hand as well as all of the importation documents. Please don't email me since i don't use a smartphone so just call or text me anytime of the day. Pictures go from the start of how it looked in Japan to the progress of my ownership. Also upon purchase i will pay to have the car completely detailed for the new owner Thank you for looking!!

They began the industrial design process by drawing inspiration from a somewhat unexpected source - the luxury and high-performance car industry. \n \nWhy High-Performance Cars? \nSimply, because the design teams at Aston Martin, Bentley, Rolls Royce and other leading manufacturers are skilled at introducing innovative technological advancements while simultaneously maintaining the feel, essence, and intangible qualities of their cherished brands.  And in essence, that's the challenge Midas also faced when creating the M32 console. So in order to create a future-forward design that took the MIDAS legacy even further, they enlisted the help of Rajesh Kutty, a leading industrial designer known for his work with celebrated luxury auto manufacturers such as Bentley, etc. Kutty started by examining the design elements that have made MIDAS consoles so highly sought after - from the straightforward, logical layout to the unparalleled usability and ergonomics.  These are characteristics that live sound engineers around the world have come to rely on, and are key aspects of the MIDAS legacy. With these design elements in mind, Kutty set forth to create a styling that would be modern, innovative, futuristic, and stunningly elegant. Many different construction materials were tested.  Countless design variations were explored.  And in the end, a styling was chosen that represented the perfect marriage between aerodynamic artistry and uncompromising performance.  The design is both ultramodern and distinctly classic at the same time. \n \nThe Landmark in Console History \nA close look at M32 reveals that the styling is completely new in every sense of the word.  Rajesh Kutty's automotive-inspired design elements mesh perfectly with a recognisable MIDAS signature, setting the M32 apart from any other console.  Its beautifully streamlined and elegant form factor completely revolutionises the experience of live mixing. The MIDAS M32 construction is equally impressive, and is designed to offer you years of reliable performance while withstanding the demanding environment of live performance venues.  M32 employs a predominantly space-frame construction, with parts of the sub-frame consisting of durable and lightweight carbon fiber and aluminium.  Multiple alloys have been employed throughout to guarantee maximum component efficiency and an improved performance-weight ratio. The M32 is an innovative, evolved design that brings together modern construction principles and high-tech materials into a styling that's destined to go down as a landmark in console history. \n \nIndustry-Leading 192 kHz Precision \nThe groundbreaking M32 console combines legendary MIDAS sound quality with advanced digital technology, future-proof 96 kHz capable open architecture design and industry-leading 192 kHz ADC and DAC converters, creating a revolutionary mid-format live console.  M32 features ultra-sleek styling, offering you a truly luxurious mixing experience.  High-end construction materials including carbon fibre provide unparalleled durability and strength, plus substantially lower weight than comparable consoles. The M32 utilizes award-winning MIDAS PRO Series microphone preamplifiers and the custom-designed MIDAS PRO motorised faders that are rated for 1 million life cycles-three times more than other leading consoles. The MIDAS M32 is a future-forward console that completely raises the bar for live mixing. \n \nLegendary MIDAS Sound Quality \nWhile the MIDAS M32 design, styling, and construction will surely turn a lot of heads, it's the sound that matters most to engineers and performing artists.  And that's where M32 shines even brighter - as the latest in a long line of pristine-sounding MIDAS consoles, it descends from a celebrated lineage that literally set the standard in electrical design and sound quality.  Ever since MIDAS consoles first found fame 40 years ago with acts like Billy Joel, Yes, The Beach Boys, Pink Floyd and others, the MIDAS legacy has always been about uncompromising quality and the ultimate in sound reproduction. Backing the analog input section are audiophile Cirrus Logic multi-channel 192 kHz capable A/D converters, which boast a 114 dB dynamic range, ensuring impressively low distortion and low noise performance. \n \nBuilt for Tomorrow \nThe M32 is a console built for today, and tomorrow - its future-proof 96 kHz capable open architecture design and industry-leading 192 kHz 24 bit ADC and DAC converters provide outstanding state-of-the-art audio performance. \n \nAward-Winning MIDAS Mic Preamplifier \nThe MIDAS mic preamp is considered by leading live sound and recording engineers to be the very essence of the famous MIDAS sound.  More than 40 years of design experience paired with the finest choice of premium-grade components lead to the acclaimed warmth and depth, bring out subtle ambience, maintain spatial positioning, and more effectively capture a precise image.  The acclaimed sound of the award-winning MIDAS microphone preamplifier has inspired generations of live sound engineers to their best work, creating sonic landscapes that have captivated audiences worldwide. \n \nCreating Sonic Landscapes \nThe MIDAS preamplifier design eliminates typical imbalances of gain-setting stages, thereby improving the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and harmonic distortion to an almost immeasurable level.  The constant high-frequency bandwidth topology assures excellent stability, RF rejection and noise performance at all gain levels, contributing to its transparent, open and dynamic sound.  But it doesn't end there, over the years many mix engineers have found that this robust and overload-tolerant design takes on a whole new dimension of sound when driven hard, the pristine audiophile reproduction giving way to just the right combination of harmonics, a warm and organic sound heard by millions of concertgoers and recorded for posterity on countless live albums over the years. \n \nSince pristine sound always begins with the microphone preamplifier, the first point where your signal enters the console, M32 features genuine MIDAS microphone preamplifiers which faithfully reproduce every sonic detail so no part of a performance will ever be missed.  Transparent and pristine sound, low noise and high common-mode rejection are all hallmarks of this classic design. The microphone preamplifiers are the very same ones used in the industry standard MIDAS XL4 and HERITAGE 3000 consoles, which many consider to be the greatest analogue live consoles ever built.  Over the past decade, the XL4 and HERITAGE 3000 have been utilised by countless top artists including Bon Jovi, Alanis Morrisette, AC/DC, Coldplay, Kid Rock, Metallica, Alicia Keys, Foo Fighters, Christina Aguilera, Sir Paul McCartney, Pearl Jam, and many more. The M32 draws from this same legacy to bring you a professional level of audio quality and performance. \n \nWhat Makes the M32 Possible is Everything \nWhether you come from an analogue mixing background, or are accustomed to using other digital consoles, your first experience with M32 has been engineered to be intuitive, fluid and straightforward. The brilliance of the M32 is its simplicity and workflow.  Tactile controls allow smooth adjustments to critical elements as the mix progresses while the TFT screen keeps you informed every step of the way.  This integration of tactile controls, motorised faders and the array of LCD and TFT displays makes the M32 experience the premiere solution for Live Sound, Broadcast, Studio Recording and Post Production applications. M32 changes the game by completely rethinking what is possible in a digital mixer.  An intuitive workflow coupled with a fully interactive user interface ensures immediate familiarity and instills confidence.  Advanced engineering and meticulous design deliver stellar sonic performance at an extremely affordable price - changing the game entirely. MIDAS' experience spans over 40 years at the very top end of the live audio industry on countless world tours by the greatest artists and the most prestigious events.  40 years of relentless research, development with 300 of the world's best engineers plus complete control over the manufacturing process.  This is what powers the M32. Above all, M32 is designed to put the power of digital in your hands, without compromise.  MIDAS' singular focus on a matchless value proposition means M32 integrates advanced features such as motorised faders, LCD scribble strips, integrated personal monitor mixing and true high-speed digital audio networking as standard features. \n \nYour \"Mind-to-Sound\" Interface \nM32 is your \"mind-to-sound\" interface - the intersection of creativity and production. Whether you're accustomed to digital mixers or not, the M32's intuitive user interface offers a fluid mixing experience that instantly feels like home. From the first moments of use, the workflow unfolds in a way that strips away obstacles, distractions, and hesitation. \n \nElements of Flow \n \nChannel Strip \nThe M32 Channel Strip puts the most important channel processing parameters into one section so that no matter which channel you are working on, the controls are always the same. This highly-efficient layout stems from MIDAS decades of console design and input from our users.  Optimized control illumination ensures a clear indication of levels or status from any viewing angle. Illuminated rotary encoders and switches give you control of preamp settings, frequency shelving, dual dynamics sections, as well as multi-mode fully parametric EQ, bus sends, main, mono and stereo panning. \n \n7\" Main Display \nM32's 7\" day-viewable color TFT (Thin-Film Transistor) display shows the setting parameters you need when you need them. Selected for its high-contrast performance and outdoor visibility, TFT is ideal for concert and open air festival venues.  Flanked by high-precision, context-sensitive tactile encoders, the screen comes to life and immediately reports in high definition all adjustments applied to a wide range of parameters. Intelligent design puts control of vital functions such as Effects, Metering, Routing and much more 1 or 2 button presses away. \n \nSends On Fader \nM32 brings the convenience of digital mixing to your Aux and output bus mixes too, thanks to its integrated Sends on Fader feature.  This incredible function allows you to build powerful, dedicated sub-mixes for monitor, secondary zone feeds, and much more-all without affecting the front of house mix or levels. The M32 allows you to send your choice of signals to any Aux or output bus and then dial in the perfect mix via the channel faders. The console remembers where you set the faders and instantly recalls them when you select a bus for quick adjustments. \n \nDCA Groups \nDCA (Digitally Controlled Amplifier) groups allow control over several signals at once without actually mixing them into a subgroup bus.  M32's 8 DCA groups let you control multiple signals via a single fader, such as the entire drum mix, the horn section, or the backup vocalists, etc. DCA control affects the FOH mix, while allowing the individual buses to remain unchanged.  The result is a customizable workflow that provides maximum flexibility, but still allows individual buses and subgroups to serve the purpose they were intended for, such as zone sends, broadcast feeds, etc. \n \nView Function \nAcross the M32, you'll find 11 strategically-placed View buttons associated with various functions.  These buttons enable immediate access to information about that specific function. For instance, if you press the View button in the Equalizer section, information for that channel's EQ is instantly shown on the main display, providing in-depth editing of all related parameters. This direct access to visual fine-tuning gives the engineer a level of control previously available only on consoles costing exponentially more. \n \nAssign Section \nWhile some digital consoles offer a few user-definable controls, M32's Assign section sets a new standard by providing a total of 36 fully customizable controls on three separate layers. As with channels and buses, individual Scribble Strips are provided for immediate identification.  Buttons can be defined to toggle parameters on/off, adjust timing of effects by tapping, or jump to specific screen views. Rotary encoders with LED collars can be assigned to specific channel parameters, or to additional parameters in the Dynamics section relevant to the current channel selection. \n \n\"Acoustic Integration\" - the Live Sound Revolution \nLegendary 40-year old British company TURBOSOUND, famous for producing some of the world's best speaker systems, have teamed up with MIDAS to seamlessly integrate mixer and speaker systems. We call it \"Acoustic Integration\". The M32's ULTRANET bus allows streaming up to 16-channels of pristine digital audio to an array of TURBOSOUND iQ speakers - all on a single CAT5 cable, along with control data to set sound presets remotely. Furthermore, the iQ Series features \"True Physical Modeling\" of some of the most popular speakers which can be easily remote controlled via the M32, allowing the sound engineer to apply different speaker models in real time from the comfort of the mixing desk. \n \n100-Band RTA for all Channel/Bus EQs \nThe M32 includes a high-resolution 100-band Real Time Analyzer (RTA), with full Bar and Spectrograph views.  This high-resolution RTA displays the audio energy distribution in 100 frequency bands over time - capturing a sonogram window of a full 10 seconds. Switch between the Large RTA view, displaying any available signal in full screen resolution, or the Combined view with the RTA view shown above each of the channel and bus EQ curves.  See the results of your filtering choices in the audio spectrum directly. Additionally, the RTA can be displayed on top of the 31-band graphic EQs in the FX rack. Monitoring and controlling frequencies has never been easier. \n \n16 Breathtaking FX \"Plug-Ins\" Based on True Physical Modeling \nMidas has added 16 FX \"Plug-Ins\" to the M32, giving you access to a total of 50+ effects that would otherwise cost tens of thousands of dollars in hardware. This latest generation of high-end FX \"Plug-Ins\" is based on True Physical Modeling of classic audio hardware.  Midas essentially \"rebuilt\" classic analog gear in the digital domain and included models of legendary processors such as Urei's 1176, Teletronix LA-2A and Fairchild 670 compressors as well as the legendary Pultec EQP-1a and EQ5 equalizers etc.  They also added a cutting-edge 5-band multiband compressor. Last but not least, the M32 can now run 4 studio-quality stereo reverbs together with 8 channels of 31-band graphic EQ.  This allows you to replace your old outboard gear with a fully recallable onboard solution. \n \nGain Splitting and Remote Control for FOH and Monitoring \nA Gain Split mode separates channel gain (trim) from the head amp gain, allowing both the FOH and/or the monitor engineer to adjust local trim digitally - and independently of the preamp gain. Additionally, the HA Gain Remote option allows console gains to be remotely controlled by an external console, such as when using the M32 as a stage box. \n \nMore Routing and Processing Flexibility \nThe M32's routing becomes even more flexible with this recent firmware upgrade.  Output signals and XLR outputs are now treated separately, allowing signals from AES50 sources or expansion cards to be routed directly to the M32's analog outputs. For example, now you can use the outputs from an M32 for directly routing back PA or monitoring signals from a main or FOH console.  Output tap points can be set as pre- or post-mute for greater usability with your P16 personal monitoring mixers.  This is very useful in situations where you don't want mute groups to interrupt your signal flow. \n \nMighty New Tools for Scene and Show Management \nIntroducing the Cue List, an innovative way to automate the loading of scenes and new \"Snippets\" at different points during a show.  Each of the 500 Cue entries can load any of the 100 Scenes or Snippets separately or at the same time.  This gives you an amazing total of 500 Cues x 100 Scenes x 100 Snippets. For example, store your favorite EQ settings for drums on channels 1-8 as a Snippet, recallable in an instant as its own preset, completely independent of the console's overall scene.  It's like taking a snapshot of a parameter on an input, return, FX slot, bus, Matrix, Main or DCA group - and saving it for quick access whenever you need it. \n \nThe MIDAS PRO FADER - Rated for 1 Million Life Cycles \nIn Midas' pursuit to lead the industry in every possible aspect, they decided to design the world's most reliable motor fader.  They dove deep into materials science, employing semi-precious metals that offered the durability they desired.  They took painstaking care to design a motorized fader that would provide continuous performance night after night, year after year. After spending a great deal of time working with metal vendors, Midas developed precision components that offer high linearity, robustness, and smooth feel during operation.  They needed ultra-straight high-grade steel guide rods with smooth polished surfaces-and they got them.  They worked closely with theit manufacturing partners to maintain the tolerance of their parts, always choosing the most suitable materials and controlling the processes to ensure consistent moulding quality and eliminating the warping and deformation caused by shrinking as the parts cool. True, none of this was easy - they spent many long hours developing the MIDAS PRO FADER design.  However, the results speak for themselves. MIDAS PRO FADERS are rated for up to 1,000,000 cycles-three times that of other leading manufacturers. \n \nLCD Scribble Strips \nA total of 29 programmable LCD Scribble Strips offer channel/bus identification that mirrors what is being controlled. Use them to enter input/output tags, plus add icons you recognize at-a-glance.  Then assign colors to create visual groups for immediate, on-the-fly recognition of similar inputs. Simple, elegant and effective - plus you'll never need masking tape again. \n \nVirtual Effects Racks ( See above for images ) \nM32 includes an extensive array of onboard effects, rendering outboard processing racks a thing of the past.  The Virtual FX rack features 8 true-stereo, studio-grade effects engines each assignable to any input, group or output mix bus.  Choose from high-end FX modules including a range of reverbs, delays, EQs, dynamics and much more. \n \nEach FX algorithm has been completely re-imagined for stunning performance - typically costing several times the price of the M32. \n \nCustom-designed, and physically modeled after some of the most iconic and sought-after processors, all effects run inside the low-latency environment of the M32 mix engine, ensuring flawless performance, flexible routing and the end of cable faults forever. \n \nThe immaculate tube signal path in Teletronix' LA-2A Leveling Amplifier has left its exceptional clarity, its rich and warm compression on countless albums of the past decades. \n \nThe ultra-smooth optical attenuator is closely modeled in Midas' LA COMPRESSOR .  It provides breezing, natural and effortlessly musical compression. (Inspired by Teletronix LA-2A.) \n \nWhen Urei released the 1176LN Limiting Amplifier in the late '60s, it broke new ground.  Field Effect Transistors employed were just invented and the 1176 was one of the first audio processors to benefit from this new technology. \n \nMidas' digital re-incarnation, ULTIMO COMPRESSOR , is based on the early Rev. E model and authentically captures the smooth character of the original class-A output stage and its FET's legendary fast Attack. (Inspired by Urei 1176LN.) \n \nThe Fairchild 670 tube compressor not only achieves record bids in high-end vintage gear auctions, it also delivers some of the finest colorations in compressor history.  Two small trim VR's preset the control side chain action, a six-step switch determines the timing, and the two large Input and Threshold knobs adjust the levels. \n \nMidas' FAIR COMPRESSOR model is true to the original signal path, and conveniently provides models for dual, stereo-linked or M/S operation. (Inspired by Fairchild 670.) \n \nThe COMBINATOR is an amazing 5-band compressor that emulates famous broadcasting and mastering compressors. \n \nA highly complex processor, the COMBINATOR utilizes automatic parameter control that produces stunning and \"inaudible\" results.  Makeup-gain for each frequency band will automatically be adjusted by the Spectral Balance Control (SBC) function, to maintain a balanced audio spectrum. \n \nThe XTEC EQ1 is undisputedly one of the best passive studio equalizers ever manufactured.  Virtually indescribable, recording engineers claim the Pultec EQP-1a to be the \"secret sauce\" of sound enhancement. \n \nMidas analyzed this classic to the core and created an exact physical model that reproduces the multi-faceted sound in painstaking detail. Even the transformers and tube output stage have been faithfully modeled. (Inspired by Pultec EQP-1a.) \n  \nPultec simply wrote the book on passive equalization.  By digitally \"rebuilding\" every aspect of the original Pultec classic, Midas captured the very essence in their parametric equalizer XTEC EQ5 .  Their digital re-incarnation is based on the original model and authentically emulates the smooth character of the its rather unique components. (Inspired by Pultec MEQ5.) \n  \nThe SUB OCTAVER provides two channels of earth-shattering sub-harmonics generation, one or even two octaves below the input signal.  While originally designed for bass players, the effect can be adjusted for Hi, Mid and Low frequency tracking to apply to a wide range of applications.  This is your secret weapon for beatboxing. \n  \nThe EDISON EX1 is the re-incarnation of Midas' own analog classics.  This remarkably-effective tool allows manipulation of the stereo field.  Selectable M/S input/output modes allow the processing or creation of M/S recorded sound sources. (Inspired by BEHRINGER EDISON.) \n  \nThe SOUND MAXIMIZER restores natural brilliance and clarity to any audio signal by adjusting the phase and amplitude integrity to reveal more of the natural texture of the sound, which is often hidden when using some effects and equalizers. (Inspired by Sonic Maximizer 482i.) \n  \nThe DIMENSIONAL CHORUS is the perfect emulation of what has been referred to as \"the best analog Chorus unit ever created\".  Four simple Mode preset buttons activate amazing effects, best described as \"space\" and \"dimension\".  Absolutely faithful to the original, multiple preset buttons can be pressed simultaneously. (Inspired by Roland Dimension D Chorus.) \nMODULATION DELAY combines three of the most used time modulation effects into one easy-to-operate unit.  Enjoy true-stereo delay with a lush and spacious chorus, topped off with three reverb models to choose from. \n \nThe Lexicon 480L has been recognized as the gold standard of digital reverb.  We have included three of the finest reverb models - Rich Plate, Room and Rich Chamber .  The M32's models precisely capture all nuances based on Midas' \"True Physical Modeling\" and their algorithms even incorporate the unit's AD/DA gain stepping converters - nailing the entire analog and digital circuit paths right down to the last detail. (Inspired by Lexicon 480L.) \n \nEXCITERS increase presence and intelligibility in live sound applications and are indispensable for adding clarity, air and harmonic overtones in the recording studio.  ENHANCERS let you emphasize the Bass, Midrange and Hi output at selectable frequencies. \n \nYou can generate maximum punch, clarity and detail, without turning up the overall volume. (Inspired by Aphex Aural Exciter and SPL Vitalizer.) \n \nMidas' TruEQ STEREO GEQ delivers musical and responsive signal processing-perfect for general room equalization, indispensable for monitoring.  M32 provides up to 16 mono graphic EQs, in addition to the multi-band parametric EQs in all channels and buses, to cope with the most demanding stage monitoring situation. \n \nPlus, the M32's motorized faders can be switched to control the filter bands of the graphic EQ, with the channel LCDs showing the corresponding filter frequencies-and you can even put this on a user defined hot-key for immediate access. (Modeled after KLARK TEKNIK DN360) \n \nVINTAGE ROOM stands out head and shoulders over other competing reverberation strategies in the way it models sound propagation in air and room resonances.  Invented in the early '80s, the role model delivered authentic room character from an algorithmic reverb long before convolution-based processing was available. \n \nIt is an ideal reverb for mixes or sub-groups, as it adds space to complex signals-highly valued in classical music and broadcasting environments. (Inspired by Quantec QRS.) \n \nPLATE REVERB emulates the characteristics of a plate reverb chamber with control over the damping pad, modulation depth and speed, and crossover.  PLATE REVERB will give your tracks the sound heard on countless hit records since the late 1950s. (Inspired by Lexicon PCM70.) \n \nThe 3-TAP DELAY in the M32 records the input signal and then echoes it back after a user-definable period of time and number of repeats.  What makes the stereo and triple delay useful and outstanding is the linked tap-timing and musical choice of echo patterns. \n \nUse the 3-TAP DELAY to fatten up vocals and instruments, or to add an enhanced spatial element to any performance. \n \nThe HALL REVERB effect provides a broad spectrum of reverberation possibilities, from small room to large, or even cavernous proportions.  When softly mixed with the original signal, Hall Reverb can be used to create a warm, more natural sound. (Inspired by Lexicon 480L.) \n \nThe handy dynamic FLANGER & DELAY duo blends the \"whoosh\" of soaring jet planes with classic Delay, and can be adjusted from mild to wild.  This combination effect only takes up one FX slot. (Inspired by Lexicon PCM70.) \n \nWAVE DESIGNER is a powerful tool for adjusting signal transients and dynamics such as attack and sustain.  Use it to make a snare drum really \"crack\" in the mix or level out volume inconsistencies of slap bass tracks. (Inspired by SPL Transient Designer.) \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_jKiZxLTTXzf_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_hVxZZt5pRey_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_jxLiOvwnKDv_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_haWFTJTAkBz_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "40.706067", "lng": "-73.793707", "postId": "5946715717", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/msd/5946715717.html", "postDate": "2017-01-05T13:07:33-0500", "updateDate": "2017-01-11T11:22:24-0500", "attributes": "new Midas M32", "locAccuracy": "highest", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/msd/5946715717", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:05:41.321371", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

Not everything shown in the pictures is still available. Read the list of items below for the most up-to-date availability. If you're not sure what an item is you can look it up using the manufacturer's item number listed in the parentheses. \n \nI bought everything for a personal project. Each item was only used on a few dozen shoots and I'm only selling it because the project's done shooting now. Almost every item is under 18-months-old and in very good to excellent condition. \n \nNone of this equipment has ever been used in a photo studio and all of it was bought new by me. I'm very careful with all of my equipment and every item is in better condition than you would get buying used from a photo studio where items are used every day on set. If you want to buy as cheaply as possible go shop somewhere else, I'm sure you can find a heavily beat up version for less somewhere else, but if you want an item in excellent to like new condition with a nice discount to boot this is the best you'll find. So for all those reasons I'm knocking 20% off the list price of every item listed (except where noted). \n \nThe softboxes are very high quality Chimera brand softboxes.

I built this PC with music production in mind, so it has good specs. It has an SSD so if you load the OS on there it'll be real zippy. \n \nWhats good about a PC like this? Its totally modular so if one part breaks all you have to do is go on youtube and replace that part. If a part gets outdated, you do the same thing and replace that one part.  \n \nThis specific model does not have a super crazy graphics card since Im not much of a gamer, so I dropped the price to compensate for that.  \n \nSpecs: \nCase \nNZXT \n- Room for six hard drives \n- Room for 3 CD drives \n- Very spacey as you can see in the pictures \n- Water cooling capable \n- is quiet but cools really well \n \nMotherboard \n- asus z87 pro \n- Room for 4 sticks of RAM  \n- Decent built in graphics card (but if you game you're gonna want to get a better card) \n \nProcessor  \n- Intel i7 4790 3.6ghz (this was top of the line when I got it, but it's still probably more processing power than you'll need) \n- fan included  \n \nRAM  \n-8gb (two more slots in the motherboard), but 8 is more than enough for day to day use \n \nStorage \n-1 terabyte HDD (Western digital)  \n-250 GB SSD (Samsung) (install the operating system on here \ud83d\udc4c) \n \nPower Supply \n-Its in there works, should last for years \n \nLet me know if you have any questions about anything and I'll be happy to answer what I can. I'd like to meet in a public place somewhere to do the sale. This is a great machine but unfortunately just doesn't suit my needs anymore. \n \nThanks, \nJohn    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_6pIc5hUdGM4_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_6qrUOzSsTHJ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01616_3e61Ifi1hOF_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00h0h_b0SpTWcWwmw_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00404_3UZ7KtOa7mt_600x450.jpg"], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5951233063", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/sys/5951233063.html", "postDate": "2017-01-08T20:11:09-0500", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "medium", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/sys/5951233063", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:05:45.197714", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "2005 Subaru Impreza WRX STi", "price": "17000", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Patterson", "description": "\n         \nUp for sale is an Aspen White 2005 Subaru Impreza WRX STi. I am the 3rd owner of the car, the last guy just bought it from his dad. Never owned by a teenager. This car has been meticulously taken care of and it is mechanically sound and will be for a long time to come. I HAVE ALL SERVICE RECORDS AND RECEIPTS. It just passed New York State Inspection in August. This care has been tastefully modified with longevity in mind. For that reason, it has not been raced, tracked, or launched. The odometer reads 127K with about 26K on a new OEM STi block from Subaru after a blown gasket. The number will continue to go up as this is my daily driver. The turbo was replaced with a new oem one around the same time. Shifts smoothly through all six gears and pulls hard everytime. Reason for selling is that I want something a little more comfortable. Don't take that the wrong way, I love this car and it's a blast to drive, I just think it's time for a change.

{"title": "2001 Clk320", "price": "1", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Bay Ridge", "description": "\n         \n2001 Clk320 \nSilver Exterior- 8.5/10 (Couple of small flaws but still alot of life left. Had it professionally detailed and waxed so every time you get a car wash the car comes out looking like a mirror) \nBlack Interior-9/10 (Small Rip in the drivers seat right where the left shoulder would be. Seems to be common on these cars) \n75k and change. Miles will go up slowly since it is my daily driver \n \nI am the second owner of the car. The original owner was an older man from Ohio. Since Ive had the car in the past 4 months I have done ALOT of maintenance. Not that it was necessary but I like to take care of my cars because then they take care of you and you never have to worry about any issues.  \n \nSince owning it I have changed all 12 spark plugs and put in high end Bosch Platinum Iridium 4 plugs. \nI had the upper gasket pulled and resealed (usually a common problem that this tends to leak so had it done before it became a problem) \nALL BRAND NEW suspension completely replace with OEM Mercedes parts \nFresh Oil change done 2x since Having the car. I did it when i got the car then fresh oil was put in again when I did the gasket. So maybe only 1500 miles on the oil. \n4 Brand new All Season Continental Extreme Contact Pro tires (mounted and balanced) great for snow, rain etc. \nFixed and changed both fog lights \nUpgraded Hid Headlights- Brighter and Better vision \nInterior and Exterior professionally detailed \nCar has an aftermarket Pioneer Radio with USB & Aux \nPre wired for amp set up- Has RCA and remote wire ran to the trunk. Has power wire & ground in trunk as well  \nBattery was replaced about 4 months ago.  \n \nWindows were tinted out to 20%  \nAc was completely dumped and fresh Freon was put in and topped off. Ac will freeze you out of the car.  \nBrand new Ac filter was put in.  \nAll fluids were checked, and were either changed or topped off if needed \nTiming chain and Water pump are in perfect working order. Was not changed by me but you can tell was changed at some point. 0 play in the timing belt. \n \nHas Heated Seats you can cook an omelette on \nHeat works great!  \n \nThis car has NO issues mechanically. Drove it from Brooklyn to Deep NJ (Jersey Shore) and drove like a dream. Felt like a brand new 2016 car. Only reason for selling is I have no money for a secondary vehicle and I really need a truck. So selling this to catch up on bills and hopefully find myself a good running truck. Bring your mechanic take a look at the car. I have nothing to hide. Im sure im also forgetting a couple of things that i did to it.  \n \nAsking 6,450 obo. EXTREMELY clean overall and drives like a dream! \n \nI paid 5k for the car a couple of months ago and probably about another 5k in maintenance into the car. But this car is now set for the next 10 years to take care of someone all you would need to do is basic maintenance like oil change. text preferred no phone calls I do not answer numbers I don't recognize. Please don't waste my time or yours, do not offer me low ball numbers or waste my time and your. I will just end up keeping it like I originally planned then    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_jpZekoqQGUw_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_a5HBAd5vdIL_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_1a6PtKQEr7c_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "40.625100", "lng": "-74.030300", "postId": "5890841142", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/cto/5890841142.html", "postDate": "2016-11-24T15:06:52-0500", "updateDate": "2016-12-22T11:24:49-0500", "attributes": "2001 Mercedes Benz CLK320 like new 6 cylinders rwd gas 75500 silver clean automatic coupe", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/cto/5890841142", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:05:50.883018", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "SABA AIR commercial appliances  Brand new freezers refrigerators preps", "price": "2090", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "USA", "description": "\n         \n \n  \n \nI Sell at very low prices and the manufactures do not allow me to put the prices in adds (it upsets other restaurant equipment dealers!) BUT YOU CAN CALL ME my cell is 310 292-1182 and I can give you the price I can sell to you at delivered to you. Many times customers tell me they were quoted for used items more than I am selling them a new one for. Many times a new one is cheaper than the repair cost of your old unit.\n  \n \nI SHIP FROM MANY WAREHOUSE'S ACROSS USA\n  \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n \nI am one of the very largest sellers of SABA AIR in the USA. I know refrigeration and cooking equipment very well. I can help guide you to the correct piece of equipment you need. When you share with me information on your business I can guide you to the right size and piece of equipment you will need. I am knowledgeable on many manufactures of equipment and the pros and cons of different units.\n  \n \nLet's WALK THRU AN EXAMPLE\n  \n  \nLet's use an example that you have a 1600 square feet sit down restaurant with 40 seats, serve beer and wine, serve bistro style food and have a 10' hood what should the equipment be under the hood and what size refrigeration items. Assuming a 10' hood you are required to have 6\" clearance on left and right side of hood unless you have walls on both sides at end of hood so without walls you have 9' to use on equipment. We will start with a typical layout 3' for stove with 6 burners and oven with 36\" salamander on top of stove, 16\" for fryer 40 pound (if cooking frozen fries go to 50 pound), 36\" char grill (use radiant for clean burn, char rock for flavor), 18\" single or double pot stove. This is your 9' of equipment change menu or style and length of hood and equipment will change. If you need griddle we can shorten char broiler and eliminate pot stove or go to 24\" range or cook top. On refrigeration you would need at least 48\" in sandwich/ salad prep refrigeration normal would be 72\" if you have room in walkways go with Mega for more food pans (mega is 7\" deeper front to back). Should have a 2 door freezer (I prefer bottom mount compressor) but depending on items may get by with 1 door freezer. On refrigeration a small walk in 6' by 6' is best but at least a 3 door refrigerator bottom mount compressor. On bar you have several choices I would need to talk with you to make recommendations. There are many things to discuss from type of chair and layout and so on. I can provide more than just to sell you an item.\n  \n \nLet's TALK REBATES\n  \n   \nAcross the USA many utility companies offer excellent rebates on many of the products we sell for being energy star. Rebates run from $50 to $600 on refrigeration/ freezer items. For example Edison offers on stainless solid door freezers $300 for a 2 door and $600 for a 3 door, on glass door freezers they offer $500 for 2 door. Rebates are easy to apply for and it is nice to get funds from utility company. Call us on more details.\n   \n  \nSHOULD I BUY NEW OR USED?\n   \n  \nIt is always nice to save money what about good used equipment? Many refrigerators will last up to 20 years but I consider the life span to be 10 years so if a unit is 10 to 15 years old there is no real value for the unit even if it is working today and if it is 8 years old you may get some use out of it. It is common that a customer will tell me they found a 2-year-old 2 door freezer for $2000. When I look up the serial numbers it may be 15 plus years' old I find it not to be working properly and really no value. On working correctly, they say it cools down, but working and working correctly can be a BIG difference. For a freezer it must reach 0 degrees to negative 10 degrees, on refrigerator it must be between 33 degrees and 40 degrees. So a freezer at 10 degrees and refrigerator at 45 degrees are working but will not pass health inspection. When you buy used they usually don't have a warranty, you have to arrange transport. If it is only a couple years old and it is super cheap you can consider it, but please do not pay a lot for an old unit that may be full of headaches. Many times I am able to sell a NEW unit at a similar price to what others will sell used AND it has full warranty. \n   \n  \n   \n  \n \nGENE SHOOK RESTAURANT EQUIPMENT  \n12583 Crenshaw Blvd  \nHawthorne, CA 90250  \n \nPhone: 310 292-1182  \nweb: www.shooksales.com  \n \n \nATOSA , mixers, mixer, oven, ovens, slicer, slicers, pizza preptable, sandwich prep table, megatop, coil, compressor, remote, walk in box, cooler, coolers, freezer, freezers, alto shaam, alto sham, cook and hold, pie press, proofer, proofers, Hobart, Baxter, revent, rotisserie, ice machine, ice machines, bakery racks, rack, conveyor, pan washer, pan washers, comtec, dutchess, dough divider, adamatic, rack oven, single, double, meat grinder, 1 door, 2 door, stainless steel, aluminum, bakery case, deli case, pastry, case, display case, dessert case, tables, equipment stands, sheet pans, muffin pan, pita oven, spiral mixer, dough sheeter, delfield, beverage air, everest, Columbus, federal, combitherm, hoshizaki, true, amana, salamander, cheese melter, glass door, food proccesor, tandoori oven, flat bread, bagel, deep fryer, griddle, stove, 6 burner, 4 burner, convection, dual temp, henny penny, pressure fryer, dough pro, savory toaster, manitowoc, yogurt machine, taylor, sink, sinks, hood, hoods, self contained, charbroiler, smoker, southern pride, bbq, barbeque, juice machine, orange juicer, blender     ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_etmo8IQYn4e_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_96RAQ85SE9m_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_j5lypryGM9U_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_3UZ66lfVMZn_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_eMtaEtF5iP4_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01414_fzmEGHACjrH_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_axdUzOpEpsa_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_q9haDGV9HB_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_8snn1qCsNJa_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_5HQ9U2ZcAaY_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_jwajYT87X1x_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_kcga56hftUr_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_7Btq5eou3fI_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01212_F5yQGkG3lW_600x450.jpg"], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5944504394", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/bfd/5944504394.html", "postDate": "2017-01-03T21:54:11-0500", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "new SABA AIR", "locAccuracy": "medium", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/bfd/5944504394", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:05:54.186668", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

Part Number: GT050Q1F-250 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \nPHYSICAL CONDITION:  *TESTED and Works GREAT!  \n\"Fully Functioning Unit\". Mint Condition as shown.  \nThe HARD DRIVE is currently Formatted for a MAC but can also be used on a PC. 2 UNITS ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR SALE. \nThe 250GB Quad Interface Hard Drive from Glyph-Technologies is an external hard drive in a GT-050 desktop enclosure. It can connect to your computer via the FireWire-800, FireWire-400, USB 2.0, or eSATA interface. The drive is designed by Glyph for use in professional audio applications. \nThe enclosure is constructed from stainless steel and features tri-laminate sound-damping to help reduce noise. This makes the drive an ideal solution for storage in audio and video production environments. \nQuad interface connects via FireWire-800, FireWire-400, USB 2.0, or eSATA  \n250GB allows for storage of approximately 18.75 hours of uncompressed DV digital video, the equivalent of 53 4.7GB DVD video discs, or up to 62,500 MP3 files. \nTri-laminate sound damping technology makes the drive ideal for audio production and video editing.  \nThe drive mechanism features a 8MB data buffer, 8ms seek time, and 70MB/sec sustained transfer when connected via eSATA. \nWhy do you need the rock-solid Glyph GT 050Q 250GB? We'll tell it to you straight. Skimping out and choosing a crappy hard drive is like buying a hot new car and giving it a set of tires that are about to bust. You would NEVER risk your car breaking down over a set of tires you know are going to kick it. So why would you let your entire recording and creative rig depend on a piece of crap, plastic drive that can't hang with your demands? For about the same price, you can get the Glyph GT 050Q 250GB. And it's so worth it. \n \nThe Glyph GT 050Q 250GB hard drive was actually designed for pro audio and pro video. Not only is it super fast (7,200 RPM), with a big cache (up to 8MB), and loaded with a ton of connectivity on the back for working in practically any studio setup (FireWire 400, FireWire 800, USB 2.0, and eSATA)  \nIf you want our opinion, the GT 050Q 250GB, and all Glyph hard drives, are the best, most dependable digital storage media we can get our hands on. It's as simple as that.   \nHow else does the Glyph GT 050Q 250GB have you covered? It's qualified to work with all of the pro audio applications you know and use today -- and the ones you're going to want to use tomorrow. And thanks to the Oxford 924 bridging chip, Pro Tools is also on this Glyph's list of qualified-to-work-with DAWs. You can rack mount the GT 050Q 250GB, so you can free up desktop space in your studio -- or use it as a part of your on-the-go rig. The ears are optional, and really affordable (Not included). To wrap it up, the GT 050Q 250GB features an ultra-quiet fan. Don't even worry about having live mics in the same room as the GT 050Q 250GB.

{"title": "2013 Honda CBR250R (With ABS)", "price": "3300", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Park Slope/Crown Heights", "description": "\n         \nSup CL, I'm selling my 2013 Honda CBR250r (ABS) motorcycle, with the rare black/black color combo which was only available from Honda on the 2013-2014 models. The motorcycle is in amazing condition, and has been stored in a secure professional parking garage, and has been covered with a Nelson-rigg bike cover whenever it was not being ridden. Only reason I'm selling the bike is because this was my first bike, had it since July 2016 and was ready for something a little more powerful, so I just upgraded to a 2015 Suzuki GSX-R 600, and don't see the sense of having two motorcycles. This is literally the best first motorcycle a person can buy, it is also amazing for commuting, I literally average around 66-71mpg with this bike, and even though my GSX-R 600 is faster, i still ride this bike more, because its comfortable, light as a feather, and fun as hell when you get it in the 6000-8000 rpm range. The bike has never been dropped, tipped over, nor abused. The oil was just changed, aswell as the chain was just inspected, cleaned, and lubed by KING CYCLES late November 2016. The bike does have a Pro-Grip Tank Pad to protect the bike from scratches when your riding in a leaned over position, aswell as a aftermarket 2Bros Carbon Fiber Black Series exhaust slip-on, which was professionally installed by KING CYCLES, and a Perilli Sport Demon rear tire (one of the best motorcycle tires) with plenty of life in them . The bike will also come with the original exhaust, even though I don't recommend putting it back on because it's very quiet, and New York has some of the worst drivers I've ever came across. For new riders, please get a motorcycle with ABS, it will protect you from idiots on the road, and potentially save your life, please don't listen to people saying you don't need ABS, take it from someone who's been riding motorcycles for 7 months now, ABS has saved my ass more than I can count from bad drivers, and bad roads. It's well worth the extra money. The motorcycle has a clean title, and only has 1,140 miles but will go up, since I still ride it whenever we get nice weather. The bike comes with 2 keys, a Nelson-rigg bike cover, a yellow brake disc lock (w/Key), and the original Honda exhaust slip-on. The bike does not need anything but a new owner, you won't even need to buy gas, because it will have a full tank of gas when it's sold. The price is non-negotiable, I'm not desperate for money, or to sell the bike. Thanks for checking my baby out,  Happy New Years to all! Please Note: For your safety, aswell as my bike's safety I will be the one test riding the bike while you follow behind me.

Larger Red/Green/Blue sub-pixel color areas within the panel create a picture that rivals LED-LCD TVs for brightness. To further improve the already impressive picture, the Super Contrast Panel combines two key innovations for enhanced black levels and color reproduction \n \nReal Black Pro II: Through technology advancement to both the hardware and software of the TV, you can now experience a richer picture quality with deeper blacks, bolder color, and higher contrast.

The result is smoother images with unprecedented picture quality, especially beneficial when viewing sports and fast action movies. \nCinema Smooth Plus: Movies are shot at 24 fps (frames per second); Cinema Smooth Plus is a refined playback process of 24p movies from Blu-ray and Satellite TV sources that accurately converts and displays content originally shot on film at 24fps as compared to the 30fps of DVD and Blu-ray disc. This allows for smoother motion scenes when watching sources shot at the standard movie rate of 24fps. \n \nHDTV Tuner: The TV has built-in over-the-air HDTV (ATSC) and Digital Cable (QAM) tuners, so you don't need a separate set-top box to receive and decode over-the-air HDTV/SDTV or unencrypted Digital Cable signals. \n \n1080p Resolution: The Samsung F8500 series Plasma TV displays all inputs at a resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080).

All HDMI inputs support x.v.Color, Deep Color, 3D, and CEC. The HDMI 3 input also supports the ARC function. The HDMI 4 input is MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link) compliant. In addition, any HDMI input can be used to connect a PC to this TV. \nComponent Video: The Plasma TV features a single component video input. The TV's component video input can also be used as a composite video input (480i only). \nHDMI (MHL) Port: The HDMI 4 port is designed for the connection of select mobile phones and other portable electronic devices using the new MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link) standard. Simply plug your MHL compatible smartphone into the TV's HDMI 4 (MHL) port using the HDMI cable that is included with your mobile phone. MHL allows you to display full 1080p video and still images on the Samsung TV from your mobile smartphone. The TV's IR remote can be used to control basic playback functions (such as Play/Pause, Stop Fast Forward/Rewind, and Menu navigation). Your MHL compliant device will also charge while connected to the TV's HDMI 4 port. To find MHL-certified devices, go to www.mhlconsortium.org. \n \nFull HD 3D (via HDMI 1.4): The Samsung F8500 series Plasma TV offers Full HD (1080p) 3D capability. Samsung 3D TV utilizes Bluetooth-enabled active shutter glasses (two pair included) for a full 1080p 3D viewing experience when coupled with a 3D source, such as a 3D-ready Blu-ray player or an HD 3D broadcast from satellite or cable providers (connected via HDMI 1.4). The Samsung F8500 series Plasma TV automatically adjusts the overall picture to provide an optimal 3D effect. The Samsung 3D TV also offers a unique feature that allows you to intensify your 2D viewing experience by up-converting it to virtual 3D.

{"title": "Line6 Pod HD500X", "price": "250", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Upper East Side", "description": "\n         \nThis HD500X has been lightly used and never gigged. It's a great FX processor but I have too much gear and we just moved to a new Manhattan apartment so a bunch of stuff has to go.  \n \nHere is a link to a video about the HD500X: \n \n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZJMSEZcS5o \n \nAnd here is the generic description of the HD500X from Guitar Center:  \n \nThe POD HD500X is the ultimate tone palette, whether you want to re-create classics or go somewhere new with the ability to recall up to 512 totally different rigs-with changes to preamp type, power amp configuration, guitar type, polyphonic alt-tuning, effects chain and more. And thanks to HD technology, POD HD500X provides the depth, character and touch nuance to inspire your creativity in the studio or on stage. So if you've never experienced the flagship of the POD family, now's the time to check out POD HD500X. \n \nWorld-Class HD Amps \nFrom vintage classics to modern powerhouses, each HD amp delivers incredible sonic depth, character and touch nuance to inspire your playing-and that's just the beginning. Customize the tone and dynamic response of each HD amp with an extensive set of deep parameters including Sag, Bias, Bias Excursion, Hum and more. \n \n100+ Studio and Stomp Effects \nPOD HD500X gives you over 100 studio and boutique stomp effects, so you can take your sound in any direction. Emulate classic signal chains with distortions, delays, mods, filters, reverbs and more, or discover entirely new sounds by mixing and matching up to eight simultaneous effects. You also get pro-grade, assignable footswitches and a built-in, die-cast expression pedal to control your effects in real time. \n \nMore Processing Power, More Creativity \nWith unparalleled flexibility and more processing power than anything in its class, POD HD500X is built for tone creation. To start, POD features dynamic DSP, so you have the freedom to stack the effects you want wherever you want them. Compared to its predecessor, POD HD500X lets you add even more effects to your signal chain. You can also mix and match HD amps, cabinets, mics and effects in virtually endless combinations. With 512 presets, you've got plenty of options for recalling your tones. \n \nSculpt Sounds with Dual Signal Paths \nLegendary guitar tones are often created with more than one signal path. POD HD500X lets you create these complex, rich tones without the setup headaches of traditional dual-amp rigs. You can route your guitar through two completely independent paths-each with its own HD amp and effects chain, of course-or process two signals at once using the 1/4\" guitar, 1/4\" auxiliary or XLR mic inputs. So whether you want to configure elaborate signal chains for more traditional stereo amp setups, or create unique soundscapes, you've picked the right tool. \n \nAssignable Footswitches and Rugged Construction \nWith POD HD500X, you get professional-grade footswitches with bright LED rings for at-a-glance operation. You can use them to enable or bypass amps and effects, or to select presets directly. If you want to get more creative, you can assign multiple amp and effects parameters to the expression pedal and morph between sounds-controlling up to 52 parameters in real time. The footswitches also control the built-in 48-second looper-an instrument unto itself.

Never taken out of the apartment.  Great effects!  Battery operated or with power supply. \n \nhttp://www.musiciansfriend.com/amplifiers-effects/boss-me-80-guitar-multi-effects-pedal \n \nPacked with tons of awesome BOSS effects and ready to hit the stage, the ME-80 is the perfect compact tone processor for gigging guitarists. A user-friendly, knob-based interface makes it quick and easy to dial in great sounds, with the flexibility of individual stompbox-style on/off or instant recall of complex multi-effects setups. Unique footswitches deliver even more control than previous designs for efficient and intuitive effects switching, patch selection, and realtime sound shaping while playing. It also includes free BOSS TONE STUDIO software to help you unlock even more tonal possibilities, plus a web connection to BOSS TONE CENTRAL for direct access to free patches created by pro guitarists and much more. \n \nFind your own personal sound with the ME-80s extensive range of built-in effects. A complete history of gig-ready BOSS tone processing is at your command, from multiple overdrives and distortions to wahs, mod effects, pitch shifters, delays, and beyond. BOSS groundbreaking Multi-Dimensional Processing (MDP) technology is represented with the unique, spacious ambience of Tera Echo and the distinctive tone-shaping possibilities of Overtone. Updated COSM preamps include new additions such as Crunch and Metal, plus an AC preamp designed for acoustic/electric guitar. \n \nUnlike typical menu-driven multi-effects processors that are complicated and unintuitive, using the ME-80 is as easy as using a stompbox. Effects are organized into eight logical categories that can all be active at the same time. Seven categories contain multiple effects types to choose from, plus dedicated knobs for selecting a type and adjusting it with a set of parameters youd find in the pedal version of the effect. The Pedal FX category has its own knob for quickly assigning a particular effects type or function to be controlled by foot with the expression pedal. You can even save all the current knob settings to one of the ME-80s 36 user patch locations. \nThe hands-on experience that stomp box control provides is perfect for tweaking tones as you go.

This is a matching number vehicle from top to bottom inside and out. Has been family owned since it was brand new. It has really been a blast to own and has always been a turn key type of car with no issues at all. Can easily and effortlessly be driven cross country. This Thunderbird turns heads everywhere it goes and gets compliments all the time. Thunderbird collectors or enthusiasts Do Not let this bird fly away without at least taking a look at this one. This car is in Showroom condition. Winner of numerous trophies from various car shows. No Bubbles No Chips No Rust No Scratches No Dings No Waves and most definitely No Bondo. The Engine is a 429 4V Thunderjet Motor with A.C. and power steering with power brakes. The Interior is jet black with bucket seats in excellent condition with no rips or torn material. The stainless steel trim in the interior has never been dinged or faded or scratched. Has the original telescopic tilt away steering wheel. Has Cobra Snakeskin exterior roof. Front and rear interior and exterior power vents still work as they should. This T-Bird has been well taken care of since it was brand new from day 1. Never smoked in and owned by non smokers. Never driven in the rain never mind the snow. Always kept inside a climate controlled garage and used during summer months only. Original owner was extremely anal on keeping up with maintenance service and has always been serviced at the local Ford dealership and always hand washed the car. Never been to a car wash. I am not car dealer I am a collector/enthusiast/hobbyist who enjoys these type of cars. Today you could not fully restore a car like this for my asking price. Never mind trying to find a good clean one to begin with. These type of cars in this type of condition are getting extremely harder and harder to find. If you do not believe me do some research and you will see there is less than a handful of 1968 Tripple Black 429 Thunderjet coupes for sale. They are extremely rare to find in this color combo. Vehicle is located in Boston Mass off I-95 and I will assist in shipping worldwide. If interested please feel free to email me through the eBay email service or call me direct at Six One Seven Four Eight Three Zero Five Zero Two and I will be happy to answer any questions you might have. No Disappointments here. Had a few say \"Yea but it is not a suicide 4 door\" Well if you want 4 suicide doors then go check out a 60s Lincoln not a Thunderjet coupe. These pictures do not do the car any justice at all. Actually they totally suck. Must be seen in person and driven to really appreciate it. Thanks for looking and best of luck on your classic car search.

The motorcycle is in amazing condition, and has been stored in a secure professional parking garage, and has been covered with a Nelson-rigg bike cover whenever it was not being ridden. Only reason I'm selling the bike is because this was my first bike, had it since July 2016 and was ready for something a little more powerful, so I just upgraded to a 2015 Suzuki GSX-R 600, and don't see the sense of having two motorcycles. This is literally the best first motorcycle a person can buy, it is also amazing for commuting, I literally average around 66-71mpg with this bike, and even though my GSX-R 600 is faster, i still ride this bike more, because its comfortable, light as a feather, and fun as hell when you get it in the 6000-8000 rpm range. The bike has never been dropped, tipped over, nor abused. The oil was just changed, aswell as the chain was just inspected, cleaned, and lubed by KING CYCLES late November 2016. The bike does have a Pro-Grip Tank Pad to protect the bike from scratches when your riding in a leaned over position, aswell as a aftermarket 2Bros Carbon Fiber Black Series exhaust slip-on, which was professionally installed by KING CYCLES, and a Perilli Sport Demon rear tire (one of the best motorcycle tires) with plenty of life in them . The bike will also come with the original exhaust, even though I don't recommend putting it back on because it's very quiet, and New York has some of the worst drivers I've ever came across. For new riders, please get a motorcycle with ABS, it will protect you from idiots on the road, and potentially save your life, please don't listen to people saying you don't need ABS, take it from someone who's been riding motorcycles for 7 months now, ABS has saved my ass more than I can count from bad drivers, and bad roads. It's well worth the extra money. The motorcycle has a clean title, and only has 1,140 miles but will go up, since I still ride it whenever we get nice weather. The bike comes with 2 keys, a Nelson-rigg bike cover, a yellow brake disc lock (w/Key), and the original Honda exhaust slip-on. The bike does not need anything but a new owner, you won't even need to buy gas, because it will have a full tank of gas when it's sold. The price is non-negotiable, I'm not desperate for money, or to sell the bike. Thanks for checking my baby out,  Happy New Years to all! Please Note: For your safety, aswell as my bike's safety I will be the one test riding the bike while you follow behind me,    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/01111_g4PitFLPnnn_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00S0S_58SEevGxWU7_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01111_71jNa3jdISl_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_90rSuQH5myA_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_bvrMEA1BzwX_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00o0o_gIKOje0uYsB_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_jTiheczmP6E_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01010_56tIIsMnFeT_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_kzBnBCuG9rU_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00202_be9dbQM2oAo_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_RtITXOUZAd_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00909_1m4R97pecrK_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_4leURbCndoa_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_8d1qs3kL7ED_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_43ijFrB0Uk8_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_ckXoaESI793_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "40.662800", "lng": "-73.954600", "postId": "5955909230", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/mcy/5955909230.html", "postDate": "2017-01-12T08:05:29-0500", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "2013 Honda CBR350r (ABS) excellent 250 gas 1140 black clean manual", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/mcy/5955909230", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:08.543942", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "New in Box Epiphone ES-175 Premium Hollowbody Gibson USA 57 Humbuckers", "price": "650", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Ridgewood", "description": "\n         \nPrice lowered for quick sale just in time for Christmas!  \n \nBrand new in box fully hollow Epiphone ES-175 Premium in natural finish. Only taken out of the box to inspect everything. This is the top of the line archtop model with USA Gibson '57 Humbuckers. If you're looking for a stunning looking, sounding, and playing jazzbox that won't break the bank, this is the one.  \n \nThese hollowbodies go for $999 on MF and GC, and this finish is not available currently so grab it while you can!  \n \nCash only. You pick up in Queens, or I can possibly meet in lower Manhattan. \n \nManufactured in the Unsung, S. Korea factory. \n \nManufacturer Info: \n \nEpiphone is proud to present the Epiphone ES-175 Premium, a faithful new reissue of what many consider the most famous electric archtop in popular music, heard on classics from jazz to rock in the hands of pioneers like Joe Pass, Scotty Moore, and Wes Montgomery. Epiphone's long history of innovation began with designing archtop guitars. And now, Epiphone steps up its game again with the new ES-175 Premium featuring Gibson USA '57 Classic pickups and a vintage-inspired \"aged\" lacquer finish that will make you think you're playing a 50's original but at a price anyone can afford. \n \nThe Roots of A Legend \nThe ES-175 was introduced in 1949 as a mid-size, more affordable version of the venerable L-5, the very first modern archtop and the inspiration for the best Gibson and Epiphone archtops of the jazz era. The original ES-175 was truly a modern guitar that anticipated a new era of jazz and pop music that was hotter, louder, and constantly stretching musical boundaries. The ES-175 was the first archtop with a Florentine (sharp) cutaway. And by 1957, it came with the innovative and now standard humbucker pickup. The ES-175 quickly the preferred model for both jazz players and rock and rollers with a background in jazz, especially for guitarists looking for the \"Wes Montgomery\" L-5 sound at a lower cost. \n \nThe new Epiphone ES-175 Premium is just like the original--a fully hollow jazz box that's easy to hold, easy to play and affordable. And with the addition of Gibson '57 Classic pickups, the Epiphone ES-175 Premium is versatile enough for any genre with cool crisp archtop tone from its all-maple construction and killer humbucker pickups. \n \nEpiphone Archtops, the Modern Standard \nThe introduction of the ES-175 Premium brings Epiphone full circle in its long history of producing affordable, professional instruments that can deliver pro sound night after night. The Epiphone ES-175 Premium features a traditional laminated Maple body with single ply binding with a vintage-inspired \"aged\" lacquer finish topped off with a traditional 3-ply black and white pickguard. \n \nThe ES-175 Premium has a hand-fitted, glued-in mahogany neck with a SlimTaperTM profile and a 24.75\" scale that's poised to come alive with the very first note you play. The bound rosewood fingerboard has classic split-parallelogram inlays and Epiphone's iconic \"sloped dovewing\" headstock is fitted with Grover 18:1 machine heads for quick, accurate, and intuitive tuning, and a standard 1.68\" nut. \n \nGibson USA '57 Classic Pickups \nEvery great electric archtop has great pickups and the ES-175 Premium truly becomes a time-traveling marvel with the inclusion of two Gibson USA \u02dc57 Classic humbucker pickups that recreate the wide tonal range and incredible sensitivity of the ES-175's original PAF-style pickups that today are the most sought after vintage pickups in the world. \n \nClassic Hardware \nAll Epiphone instruments feature rock solid hardware that's guaranteed for life. The ES-175 Premium comes with Epiphone \"Deluxe\" machine heads and full range controls for volume and tone all equipped with Epiphone's full-size 1\" 500K\u201e\u00a6 potentiometers, a rim-mounted output jack, and Epiphone's 3-way all metal toggle mounted on a traditional rubber grommet. The bridge is set up with a traditional floating rosewood base supporting a fully adjustable nickel Tune-o-matic bridge. The bridge is \"pinned\" to ensure perfect placement and intonation every time. And the classic \"Zig-Zag\" Trapeze tailpiece makes the new ES-175 Premium virtually indistinguishable from a vintage original-except for the price! An optional premium hard case is also available. \n \nLimited Lifetime Warranty \nOne thing you can't get with a vintage instrument is Epiphone's Limited Lifetime Warranty and Gibson 24/7/365 Customer Service. \n \nFeatures \nTop Material: Laminated Maple \nBody Material: Laminated Maple \nNeck Material: Solid Mahogany \nNeck Shape: SlimTaper \nNeck Joint: Glued-In, Set Neck \nScale Length: 24.75\" \nFingerboard Material: Rosewood with parallelogram inlays \nFingerboard Radius: 12\" \nBinding: Body, Fingerboard \nNut Width: 1.68\" \nHardware: Nickel \nMachine Heads: Epiphone deluxe \nNeck Pickup: Gibson USA '57 Classic Humbucker \nBridge Pickup: Gibson USA '57 Classic Humbucker \nControls: 2- Volume, 2- Tone \nPickup Selector: 3-way Epiphone all-metal toggle on traditional rubber grommet \nBridge: Floating rosewood base with tune-o-matic bridge; pinned \ntailpiece: traditional \"Zig-Zag\" trapeze \nPickguard: 3-ply: Black/White/Black \nFinish: Vintage-Inspired, \"aged\" lacquer \n \nHollowbody, hollow body, archtop, jazzbox, jazz, rockabilly, blues, sheraton, emperor, 335    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/01212_16mVEZ4IIID_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_jFvb1uuRhGD_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_2vN53lwc0Gf_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00707_1rWTStn5ctQ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_gV5zWrky8eS_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_3DxCi7X9l2d_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00404_1LNoQE8eOX2_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_jBJODwh7IGR_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_6Rh6vicN6Jo_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_dHG2Z6BZuKN_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_lp6dCcFx4tV_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "40.703600", "lng": "-73.896100", "postId": "5937788199", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/msg/5937788199.html", "postDate": "2016-12-29T16:01:02-0500", "updateDate": "2017-01-12T13:37:26-0500", "attributes": "new Epiphone ES-175 Premium", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/msg/5937788199", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:09.891993", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "Getac V110 Core i5 4th gen laptop", "price": "950", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Upper East Side", "description": "\n         \nlooking for a gaming laptop gtx 980m or higher in mint condition like this one is was given to me last year worth about 1700 used new its worth 2500 only want 950 or gaming laptop or surface pro 3 or 4 core i7 laptop works awesome not one problem  \n \nThe Getac V110 is a compact and lightweight convertible that quickly transforms from 11.6 inch display notebook to tablet computer. The V110 is among the thinnest and lightest fully rugged convertibles ever built. It is less than 12 x 9 inches in size, a mere 1.3 inches thick and weighs just over 4 pounds. The Getac V110 meets MIL-STD-810G and IP65 standards for durability and protection against dirt, dust, water, motion, vibration, temperature and other factors that would quickly damage a commercial-grade tablet. The V110's large 11.6 inch multi-touch display utilizes the revolutionary LumiBond technology to achieve a display that is more readable, and offers better contrast and more crisp colors. The V110 convertible comes with a full-size, waterproof keyboard. The red backlight allows users to type in low-light conditions without silhouetting themselves. It also reduces eyestrain, which helps reduce fatigue.  \n \n The Getac V110 is powered by Intel Core i5-4300U (1.9GHz) processor, 4GB RAM, and a 128GB solid state drive. The Getac V110 has built-in 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, and optional 4G LTE Mobile broadband to keep workers connected. The optional webcam and 5MP autofocus camera can capture images or video on the go. For vehicle deployments, three pass-through antenna ports can be added, allowing customers to simultaneously connect high-gain GPS, WWAN, and WLAN roof-mounted antennae. The V110's optional dedicated GPS offers 2x search capacity, faster location positioning and improved accuracy over competitors' embedded GPS designs. Dual hot-swappable batteries allow for endless power by simply \"swapping\" in a fresh battery without needing to shut down applications or the operating system. The Getac V110 rugged tablet also has a 3-year bumper-to-bumper warranty!  \n   This ver has dual cameras and dual batteries screen is flawless body in mint condition comes with power supply and windows 10 pro  \n \nThanks for looking  \nMilitary grade tactical laptop. \nFor military, law enforcement, construction workers, land surveyors, private investigators and tactical trainers.  \n \nBelow is the link for the product specs and details \n \nhttp://www.avadirect.com/V110-VWR101-Core-i5-4300U-1-9GHz-Tablet-PC-Barebone-11-6-WXGA-800-Nits-LED-Touch-Screen-4GB-DDR3-128GB-SSD-WC-WiFi-BT-Intel-GMA-HD-Graphic/Product/8381664    \n \n                  $950 negotiable but be nice \nPickup only no shipping cash only no checks no paypal \n \nThanks for looking  \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00h0h_19F3G1pZJHu_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_dFV1GTdi4jn_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_fMDngCWafqJ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_etECfwZkGWx_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_iiqXjGpuUtM_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00303_gWo2ahYmtv5_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "40.791800", "lng": "-73.944700", "postId": "5956535980", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/sys/5956535980.html", "postDate": "2017-01-12T15:06:19-0500", "updateDate": "2017-01-12T15:16:21-0500", "attributes": "excellent", "locAccuracy": "highest", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/sys/5956535980", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:10.942600", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

I've lost my space and this Bowflex needs to go within the week (by Sunday the 15th)! \n \nThis Bowflex Power Pro Strength Training System needs a new home with someone who is looking to get fit and has the room to use it.  It has been in the basement of our building, but we've now lost access to that space (it's been leased to someone else) so there's no room for a machine like this.  There's a little drywall dust on it from some renovation currently being done down there, but it will clean up just fine with a dry cloth. \n \nI'd love to use this machine myself -- it's perfect for getting fit, toned and strong, and you can adjust the resistance very, very easily (so it's perfect whether you're starting out without much muscle or if your already super strong).

Aligned with all of the products from Technical Pro, this unit is built to last and guaranteed to provide a high level of performance and crystal clear sound!  \n \nDo you need to play a CD, a DVD, an or MP3 Player? Do you need to connect two microphones or play an MP3 file from a USB flash drive or SD Card? Do you need an FM tuner to reference or play FM radio? In today's audio environment it's important to be able to connect multiple, varying sources to your audio system and the RX37 can handle it all!  \n \nThe RX37 back panel inputs consist of two stereo RCA inputs for two different audio sources. The front panel inputs are exactly where they should be, on the front panel! This will allow you to easily connect and disconnect an MP3 player, SD Card, USB flash drive and two microphones. These sources are usually switched in and out on a daily basis depending on your needs. Thinking ahead, Technical Pro designed this unit with ease in mind. Do you really want to go to the back panel of a rack to connect an MP3 player? Neither do we!  \n \nSo what is so special about a USB flash drive / SD Card input? Like most of us, you probably have an ever-growing library of mp3 audio files on your computer or laptop that you want to listen to while sitting on the comfort of your couch. Have you ever tripped over a wire connected to your computer or laptop and then dive onto the floor to save it from crashing and breaking into pieces? We can all agree the fewer wires in our sound system the better. A USB flash drive / SD Card lets you carry around thousands of .mp3 audio files in the palm of your hand. Simply connect the USB flash drive / SD Card to the computer and copy the.mp3 files onto the USB flash drive / SD Card. Disconnect it from the computer and connect it to the RX37 and the unit will automatically begin playing the files from the USB flash drive / SD Card. All while keeping your laptop perfectly safe.  \n \nThe outputs consist of industry standard banana binding post that can connect two speakers, push button for surround speakers, and an RCA for a record line output.  \n \nThe two microphone inputs have a tone, echo and volume control letting you adjust the signal to your needs. The overall output has separate bass and treble controls allowing you to tweak your sound and find your sweet spot! Complete with a digital fluorescent output display meter this amplifier is top notch!  \n \nIf you've spent any time at all in professional audio, you know the name Technical Pro and what it stands for--incredible performance & sound, and the ultimate in reliability under harsh conditions. And now, Technical Pro offers the same technology in a series of integrated amps and receivers bringing more of what sets Technical Pro apart from all others.  \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_fKDdIRZB5Lx_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_98SaSE7YGk3_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "40.819400", "lng": "-73.860600", "postId": "5951977004", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/brx/bar/5951977004.html", "postDate": "2017-01-09T12:35:59-0500", "updateDate": "2017-01-10T17:08:40-0500", "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/bar/5951977004", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:14.036359", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

They can generate 30-40MM with each PPV event. Those numbers represent USA PPV and the gate only, not international earnings. Plus they have several TV shows and other income streams. \n They were also just bought by IME for 4.2 BILLION and are in a transitional stage and its uncertain how things will go for them. With the very problematic current state of affairs of their organization and an acquisition this year I feel puts us in a position to take advantage of the turmoil they are experiencing (there are many, many problems within the promotion). In my opinion MMA at the top level is run with incompetence and arrogance. This is the perfect opportunity for a 2nd team to enter the game, take advantage of the opportunity and become #1. I have spent years compiling data, ideas and strategic plans to build a superior and extremely successful MMA team. \n The UFC is the ONLY Pro MMA Team! This sport needs a 2nd team. Well managed and professionally handled. One that will recognize the fighters need for much better pay and the fans need for at least 1 sport to be the real deal and more exciting. \n \n (((THIS IS A HUGE MONEY, FAST GROWING, ALL YEAR LONG, WORLD WIDE MEGA SPORT THAT INVOLVES BOTH SEXES, IS PPV'S BIGGEST SELLER, HAS ONLY 1 TOP COMPETITOR AND IT HAS NOT MADE PRO STATUS YET.)))

THIS IS A GIFT!!! \n \n I have the plans and ideas to make it extremely successful however I lack the experience and knowledge to build it. \n What I need is a partner or partners with experience in building and running a team. I need good people with good attitudes that are team players. Big League and/or TV / PPV experience is a plus. \n From investors I would figure a 15-30 Million Dollar Investment to be safe. Could be less. I read the UFC gets 100K plus for each 30 second commercial on their fox TV shows. That's 4+ Million for \"each\" 1 hr show and 30+ Million per PPV event. This would indicate a fast return on solid, multiple and monthly income streams. \n Billions are waiting for us. There's a perfect opportunity right now to do this. The fighters are disgusted with the low pay and poor treatment.

RACK ONLY. Includes lat cables which I carefully twisted for convenience. \n \nYou're looking at a Weider Pro 545 Squat/bench/power rack with a lat pulldown cables attachment on both sides of the unit, as seen on picture. Perfect for a starter home gym or someone who doesn't have time to go to a gym and just wants a small roughly 5x5 feet short unit at their house/apartment. This unit allows for practically any line of workout: bench press (please note that bench is NOT included, you'll have to get your own separately, and for the price, it's obvious), biceps via curling, deadlifting, Squatting, Overhead press for shoulders, close grip bench for triceps, rows for lats, and so much more with the assistance of this one compact unit. Its capacity has proven to hold 700LB via its bar holders and the unit also includes safety pins. Its in good condition, some obvious signs of use can be seen as weights were dropped on it but nothing that would in any way hinder its use or cause malfunction, just a few scratches here and there.  \n \nPlease note that this listing is ONLY for the rack. No bench, bar or weights are included with it. And since I do not drive and the unit is heavy, the buyer will have to come to my area in Brooklyn and pick it up. Please be aware of the fact that you'll need a big enough car as the height of the unit is 7 feet and change. I will help disassemble, and load into the car. No original packaging. No PayPal, no shipping, no checks, no BS please. I won't buy whatever bs you're selling so don't even try. Honest buyers only.

For suspension, there is an inverted fork with compression and rebound adjustments.The remote-reservoir rear shock has adjustable preload and rebound. \n \nEngine type:125cc 4 stroke Single Cylinder \nFront Suspension: Non-Adjustable 750mm \nTransmission: 4 Speed Manual Clutch \nRear Suspension: Adjustable 320mm \nStarter mode: Kick start \nBraking system: Front and Rear Hydraulic disc \nMax Power: 6.0KW (7500r/min) \nFrame: Twin Spare Heavy Duty Steel frame \n \nDIMENSIONS \nSeat Height: \nWheel base:36.51220 \nFront/Wheel Base: 17\" \nRear Wheel: 14\" \nTank Capacity: 4.7L \nGW/NW: 82/67Kg  \n \nCall for more info www.hobby-bikes.com 3476109838 Mike    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_eqwHkdz3Xae_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_fLctIQtKy92_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00202_4QcIUeEFZNq_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_9IxwQa8ekaO_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_b7Dx5VAlqnY_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_cOuZYPmTboJ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_kJeJ8hhLdgn_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_haRE552qGII_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00505_6hQnoLI2hEo_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_fe7YXLDEwZK_600x450.jpg"], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5950582150", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/mcd/5950582150.html", "postDate": "2017-01-08T11:36:01-0500", "updateDate": "2017-01-08T11:36:02-0500", "attributes": "2017 RFZ PRO SERIES gas manual", "locAccuracy": "low", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/mcd/5950582150", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:19.190102", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

Everything you need for great location lighting in one tiny package. \n \nBuilt to last, this battery powered kit is small enough for location and strong enough for the studio. The kit includes: \n \n(1) Profoto Pro-7b 1200 Watt/Second Battery Powered Pack \n(2) Profoto Pro-B Battery Cassettes (both batteries were recelled in 2014 - work like new) \n(1) Pro-7 Flash Head (not the standard 7b travel head but a full Pro 7 Head) \n(1) Pro Grid Zoom Reflector \n(1) Profoto Head Extension Cable - 16' (this are included in the total price - retail $375) \n(1) Battery Charger (Multi-voltage: 90-250VAC) \n \nThe Pro 7b generator gives you all the advantages of a heavy duty Profoto studio generator in a portable powerhouse.

Partial charging is also possible as batteries do not have a memory. \n \nThe kit has been actively used and shows signs of it but Profoto is legendary for building solid, reliable gear and everything is in good working condition. The kit sold for over $3500 new plus the extra battery and head extension would cost $4000 new. \n \nSelling the kit for $1550 cash. \n \nSerious buyer only - no trades or money order scams etc. \nIf it is still listed online it is available. \nIf you are interested email. \n \nWe are also selling other Profoto Lighting Accessories including the coveted Profoto 7b Universal Power Adaptor that allows you to plug the Pro-7b pack into the wall so you can shoot with it like a regular AC pack.

Original Sting lyrics, a drawing Axel Rose made for me on a Roc Marcy Session with Scott Free, Jenifer Lopez doodles on SSL board tape, Maroon 5 guitar picks and sketches, Ryan Adams original song compositions he left behind from Easy Tiger, Quest Love's (Roots) drum sticks he left behind from an Al Green Session, a Jimi Hendrix book Janie Hendrix signed, Sean Lennon letters... even a poster from 1972 Jimmi Hendrix hung above his bed at 52w 8th street 3rd floor in his apartment right before he died. Tons of other stuff too, quite an eclectic collection of one of a kind museum quality items all left behind from sessions I worked on here in Manhattan, AZ, Chicago, LA and Nashville. \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00000_8ZuGaZAleFr_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_iuTYQJBXe4t_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01313_dywe5qgEKkW_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_aOhMADDjJM2_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_2NLOGck3Vor_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_h6NviJHMlKL_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_lr87swaW2QQ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00909_2WBWXmOF4Fz_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_elkqogn5p5W_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_d8YxHdb0xc8_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_l69a0JRS3LE_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_jSpizDElWkk_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00707_9i6SLfclJ90_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_85fDP4591kw_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00000_CQIkaYrnqN_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_cRHnVXSjV3y_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01212_jhmx9aP1tiK_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_juzvUjB4Kwo_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_9OdCZkZIs0Q_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_hisQ52OnZse_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01414_fPPpGsv2LwR_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00707_k6oMOwLx4k0_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_h0MwQpzJulC_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_5NrG7uFZhbF_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "40.717300", "lng": "-73.879200", "postId": "5957442936", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/msg/5957442936.html", "postDate": "2017-01-13T09:54:07-0500", "updateDate": "2017-01-13T10:23:08-0500", "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/msg/5957442936", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:37.094927", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

SELLING IT FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH.  THE DAMAGE CAN BE FIXED ONLINE FOR ABOUT 700.00 AT MOST IN PARTS AND THEYRE EASY TO PUT ON.  I'VE CHANGED PARTS ON THIS CAR MANY TIMES, WHILE ON INSTAGRAM SHOWING PEOPLE WITH MY PHONE IN MY HAND.  ITS SIMPLE..  IM SELLING IT BECAUSE I HAVE TOO MANY CARS.  A LARGE OBJECT FELL ONTO THE HOOD AND CAUSED THE DAMAGE THAT YOU SEE THERE.  NO DAMAGE TO THE MOTOR OR MECHANICAL PARTS.  BEFORE THE TRANNY CONDUCTOR PLATE STOPPED WORKING IT DROVE LIKE A BRAND NEW CAR FROM 2017, AND THAT CONDUCTOR PLATE PROBLEM WAS THERE FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS, AND THE CAR LASTED THAT LONG BEFORE IT TOTALLY WENT, SO YOU KNOW THIS IS A GOOD CAR.  NO OBD 2 CODES EXCEPT FOR THE CONDUCTOR PLATE (P0700 TRANSMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM). \n \nCLEAN TITLE IM THE SECOND OWNER.  IVE NEVER HIT ANYBODY OR REAR ENDED ANYBODY ETC, THIS CAR HAS NEVER BEEN IN A REPAIR SHOP ALL IT'S LIFE.  CAR FAX IT.  IVE MAINTAINED THIS CAR SINCE IVE OWNED IT ON MY OWN AS PER THE MANUAL.  IM A MECHANIC.  I CAN FIX THE WORK THAT IT NEEDS, BUT ITS SO COLD OUT THAT I'D RATHER NOT.... OR WAIT TILL THE SPRING.   \n \nFIRST 1200.00 TAKES IT.  THERES NO TEST DRIVING THIS CAR. BRING A ODB2 SCANNER AND A STACK OF 100 DOLLAR BILLS.  I WILL EVEN HAVE IT TOWED FOR YOU FREE OF CHARGE ANYWHERE WITHIN 200 MILES, BUT I WILL NOT DRIVE THIS CAR FOR ANYBODY FOR ANY REASON.  ITS 1200 DOLLARS OR MOVE ON.  I'LL TURN THE CAR ON AND MOVE IT BACK AND FORTH FROM ITS PARKING SPACE BUT THATS IT.  NO GAMES, NO WINDOW SHOPPERS.  IM A GEAR HEAD, IM A PRO.  I KNOW THAT YOU CAN FIX THIS CAR EASILY IF YOU HAVE A HEATED INDOOR GARAGE.  IM SELLING IT FOR WHAT ITS WORTH.  FIX THE CONDUCTOR PLATE AND IT WILL RUN LIKE A BRAND NEW CAR.  I DO TOP SPEED 90 EASILY ON THE I87 UPSTATE AND I HAVE RECENT VIDEOS OF THIS. \n \nIT DOES RUN.   \nI USED TO DRIVE IT EVERY DAY FROM NEW YORK CITY TO NORTH NEW JERSEY 1HR EACH WAY. \n \nITS THE SPORT EDITION, WITH THE AMG-LIKE WHEELS AND ROUNDED MIRRORS.  NOT THE STANDARD MODEL.  BLACK WITH GRAY LEATHER INTERIOR.  RARE.  MY INTERIOR IS IN NEAR MINT, CONDITION, BUTTER SOFT AND SPOTLESS, AND SMELLS LIKE A BRAND NEW CAR INSIDE.  I WANT TO KEEP IT, BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO REPAIR IT. \nIT HAS READY TO GO XM RADIO AND NAVIGATION, DVD... THE WORKS. \n \nI DID ALOT OF MECHANICAL WORK ON THIS CAR SO THAT YOU WONT HAVE TO- THE BODY DAMAGE WAS OUT OF MY CONTROL- SO THE PRICE IS FIRM.   \nIF YOU WOULD LIKE TO START PRICE HAGGLING, I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT, I'M NOT TRYING TO HOLD ON TO THE CAR, BUT IF YOU PLAN ON PRICE HAGGLING AND BARGAINING, EXPECT ME TO START TAKING THINGS OFF/OUT OF THE CAR, LIKE THOSE FACTORY UPGRADE SPORT WHEELS, AND THE UPDATED MODERN SATELLITE RADIO SYSTEM.  THAT WIRING ALONE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN IS A 500.00 JOB, SO IM DEFINITELY TAKING THAT WITH ME IF YOU'D LIKE TO PRICE BARGAIN... I'M SELLING THE CAR ITSELF, EVERYTHING ELSE ARE ADDITIONAL GOODIES... THEY COME OFF WITH EACH PRICE REDUCTION.  AGAIN, I DONT WANT TO HOLD ON TO THE CAR, BUT I DID RE-DID THE WHOLE CAR ALMOST ALL OVER AGAIN SO YOU WONT HAVE TO, THERE ARE ABOUT 3 THINGS LEFT THAT KEEP IT FROM BEING A STRAIGHT OUT THE DEALER CONDITION CAR (EXCLUDING THE CAR ACCIDENT DAMAGE), SO YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE... I SET THE PRICE AT 1000, IF YOU WANT TO COME DOWN, ADDED BONUSES ALSO COME DOWN OFF THE CAR.  LOOK AT IT THAT WAY, AND KEEP THAT IN MIND. \n \nALL ELECTRICS WORK IN THE CAR EXCEPT FOR THE FOG LIGHTS, AND THE DASH MODE LIGHTBULB IS DIM (THE ONE THAT SHOWS ALL THE FEATURES AND TRIP DISTANCE ETC, THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE). ALL WINDOWS, SUNROOF, AIR CONDITIONING, EVERYTHING WORKS.  I JUST BOUGHT A REPLACEMENT DRIVE SHAFT SUPPORT TO UPDATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CAR, JUST BEFORE IT HAD BEEN DAMAGED. NO MECHANICAL OR ELECTRICAL DAMAGE. ONLY BODY. LIGHTS STILL WORK AND WERE NOT TOUCHED. The light HOUSING/BRACKET though, has been cracked. \n \nIT NOW NEEDS: \n1) a new hood (entire hood) 150-350 on eBay, 277 online (from automotix dot net) \n2) a new grille (although not really damaged, has a non-visible crack in the black part under the silver lines, and should be replaced if you're a perfectionist) \n3) a new light bracket (it's a gray plastic frame unit that holds the light unit to the bumper) - They sell BRAND NEW aftermarket 2016 upgrade versions that include the lights too, on ebay for 150. \n4) the bracket that holds the radiator was pushed back a bit, but no mechanical or electrical parts were affected. \n5) there is light damage to the passenger side fender, (125-175 on eBay) which I had JUST replaced, new) by the very front where the lights are bordered by the fender. I got hit in the back too, so the back rear light is cracked. An original Mercedes Benz used one on eBay right now sells for around 45.00. There are three up for sale right now. Local New Jersey Ebay sellers have the hood too, for 250.00... 277 online free shipping.  The bumper I haven't searched for. The fender sells for around 125. I bought one recently for 125. \n \nBook value for the car the way it was before the damage is 3391 even WITH all those miles I've put on.  Mercedes hold their value.  I've added a photo of the Blue Book quote.  To repair, I find the parts on eBay for cheap all the time and I usually do my own work, but this car will never be the same car to me. I'm the second owner and it was meticulously maintained and pampered. It came from a Mercedes Benz family dealer owned household in New Jersey before I bought it.  All papers and service work and original owner service papers and receipts are in my possession. Title in hand, it's registered, insured, all paperwork checks out, the car is a CLEAN rare, black with gray sport edition.  If it doesn't sell for the asking price, I will hang on to it, and repair it little by little, and not sell it.  The plates will stay on the car.  Good for parts if you need a donor car.

Aligned with all of the products from Technical Pro, this unit is built to last and guaranteed to provide a high level of performance and crystal clear sound!  \n \nDo you need to play a CD, a DVD, an or MP3 Player? Do you need to connect two microphones or play an MP3 file from a USB flash drive or SD Card? Do you need an FM tuner to reference or play FM radio? In today's audio environment it's important to be able to connect multiple, varying sources to your audio system and the RX37 can handle it all!  \n \nThe RX37 back panel inputs consist of two stereo RCA inputs for two different audio sources. The front panel inputs are exactly where they should be, on the front panel! This will allow you to easily connect and disconnect an MP3 player, SD Card, USB flash drive and two microphones. These sources are usually switched in and out on a daily basis depending on your needs. Thinking ahead, Technical Pro designed this unit with ease in mind. Do you really want to go to the back panel of a rack to connect an MP3 player? Neither do we!  \n \nSo what is so special about a USB flash drive / SD Card input? Like most of us, you probably have an ever-growing library of mp3 audio files on your computer or laptop that you want to listen to while sitting on the comfort of your couch. Have you ever tripped over a wire connected to your computer or laptop and then dive onto the floor to save it from crashing and breaking into pieces? We can all agree the fewer wires in our sound system the better. A USB flash drive / SD Card lets you carry around thousands of .mp3 audio files in the palm of your hand. Simply connect the USB flash drive / SD Card to the computer and copy the.mp3 files onto the USB flash drive / SD Card. Disconnect it from the computer and connect it to the RX37 and the unit will automatically begin playing the files from the USB flash drive / SD Card. All while keeping your laptop perfectly safe.  \n \nThe outputs consist of industry standard banana binding post that can connect two speakers, push button for surround speakers, and an RCA for a record line output.  \n \nThe two microphone inputs have a tone, echo and volume control letting you adjust the signal to your needs. The overall output has separate bass and treble controls allowing you to tweak your sound and find your sweet spot! Complete with a digital fluorescent output display meter this amplifier is top notch!  \n \nIf you've spent any time at all in professional audio, you know the name Technical Pro and what it stands for--incredible performance & sound, and the ultimate in reliability under harsh conditions. And now, Technical Pro offers the same technology in a series of integrated amps and receivers bringing more of what sets Technical Pro apart from all others.  \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_fKDdIRZB5Lx_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_98SaSE7YGk3_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "40.819400", "lng": "-73.860600", "postId": "5951977004", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/brx/bar/5951977004.html", "postDate": "2017-01-09T12:35:59-0500", "updateDate": "2017-01-10T17:08:40-0500", "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/bar/5951977004", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:42.089036", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

We Build 2nd Team to be #1", "price": "1", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Greenwich Village", "description": "\n         \nThe UFC generated a gross of \"Over 2 Billion\" in 2015 according to CNBC and research. They can generate 30-40MM with each PPV event. Those numbers represent USA PPV and the gate only, not international earnings. Plus they have several TV shows and other income streams. \n They were also just bought by IME for 4.2 BILLION and are in a transitional stage and its uncertain how things will go for them. With the very problematic current state of affairs of their organization and an acquisition this year I feel puts us in a position to take advantage of the turmoil they are experiencing (there are many, many problems within the promotion). In my opinion MMA at the top level is run with incompetence and arrogance. This is the perfect opportunity for a 2nd team to enter the game, take advantage of the opportunity and become #1. I have spent years compiling data, ideas and strategic plans to build a superior and extremely successful MMA team. \n The UFC is the ONLY Pro MMA Team! This sport needs a 2nd team. Well managed and professionally handled. One that will recognize the fighters need for much better pay and the fans need for at least 1 sport to be the real deal and more exciting. \n \n (((THIS IS A HUGE MONEY, FAST GROWING, ALL YEAR LONG, WORLD WIDE MEGA SPORT THAT INVOLVES BOTH SEXES, IS PPV'S BIGGEST SELLER, HAS ONLY 1 TOP COMPETITOR AND IT HAS NOT MADE PRO STATUS YET.))) Did you catch that? Please read it again. THIS IS A GIFT!!! \n \n I have the plans and ideas to make it extremely successful however I lack the experience and knowledge to build it. \n What I need is a partner or partners with experience in building and running a team. I need good people with good attitudes that are team players. Big League and/or TV / PPV experience is a plus. \n From investors I would figure a 15-30 Million Dollar Investment to be safe. Could be less. I read the UFC gets 100K plus for each 30 second commercial on their fox TV shows. That's 4+ Million for \"each\" 1 hr show and 30+ Million per PPV event. This would indicate a fast return on solid, multiple and monthly income streams. \n Billions are waiting for us. There's a perfect opportunity right now to do this. The fighters are disgusted with the low pay and poor treatment.

Only taken out of the box to inspect everything. This is the top of the line archtop model with USA Gibson '57 Humbuckers. If you're looking for a stunning looking, sounding, and playing jazzbox that won't break the bank, this is the one.  \n \nThese hollowbodies go for $999 on MF and GC, and this finish is not available currently so grab it while you can!  \n \nCash only. You pick up in Queens, or I can possibly meet in lower Manhattan. \n \nManufactured in the Unsung, S. Korea factory. \n \nManufacturer Info: \n \nEpiphone is proud to present the Epiphone ES-175 Premium, a faithful new reissue of what many consider the most famous electric archtop in popular music, heard on classics from jazz to rock in the hands of pioneers like Joe Pass, Scotty Moore, and Wes Montgomery. Epiphone's long history of innovation began with designing archtop guitars. And now, Epiphone steps up its game again with the new ES-175 Premium featuring Gibson USA '57 Classic pickups and a vintage-inspired \"aged\" lacquer finish that will make you think you're playing a 50's original but at a price anyone can afford. \n \nThe Roots of A Legend \nThe ES-175 was introduced in 1949 as a mid-size, more affordable version of the venerable L-5, the very first modern archtop and the inspiration for the best Gibson and Epiphone archtops of the jazz era. The original ES-175 was truly a modern guitar that anticipated a new era of jazz and pop music that was hotter, louder, and constantly stretching musical boundaries. The ES-175 was the first archtop with a Florentine (sharp) cutaway. And by 1957, it came with the innovative and now standard humbucker pickup. The ES-175 quickly the preferred model for both jazz players and rock and rollers with a background in jazz, especially for guitarists looking for the \"Wes Montgomery\" L-5 sound at a lower cost. \n \nThe new Epiphone ES-175 Premium is just like the original--a fully hollow jazz box that's easy to hold, easy to play and affordable. And with the addition of Gibson '57 Classic pickups, the Epiphone ES-175 Premium is versatile enough for any genre with cool crisp archtop tone from its all-maple construction and killer humbucker pickups. \n \nEpiphone Archtops, the Modern Standard \nThe introduction of the ES-175 Premium brings Epiphone full circle in its long history of producing affordable, professional instruments that can deliver pro sound night after night. The Epiphone ES-175 Premium features a traditional laminated Maple body with single ply binding with a vintage-inspired \"aged\" lacquer finish topped off with a traditional 3-ply black and white pickguard. \n \nThe ES-175 Premium has a hand-fitted, glued-in mahogany neck with a SlimTaperTM profile and a 24.75\" scale that's poised to come alive with the very first note you play. The bound rosewood fingerboard has classic split-parallelogram inlays and Epiphone's iconic \"sloped dovewing\" headstock is fitted with Grover 18:1 machine heads for quick, accurate, and intuitive tuning, and a standard 1.68\" nut. \n \nGibson USA '57 Classic Pickups \nEvery great electric archtop has great pickups and the ES-175 Premium truly becomes a time-traveling marvel with the inclusion of two Gibson USA \u02dc57 Classic humbucker pickups that recreate the wide tonal range and incredible sensitivity of the ES-175's original PAF-style pickups that today are the most sought after vintage pickups in the world. \n \nClassic Hardware \nAll Epiphone instruments feature rock solid hardware that's guaranteed for life. The ES-175 Premium comes with Epiphone \"Deluxe\" machine heads and full range controls for volume and tone all equipped with Epiphone's full-size 1\" 500K\u201e\u00a6 potentiometers, a rim-mounted output jack, and Epiphone's 3-way all metal toggle mounted on a traditional rubber grommet. The bridge is set up with a traditional floating rosewood base supporting a fully adjustable nickel Tune-o-matic bridge.

{"title": "Nissan Skyine R32 GTS-T Sedan", "price": "13000", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "west babylon", "description": "\n         \nHey everyone, I guess you can say the time has come to sell my car. I don't need to sell it but I've had my fun with it by sharing it with my friends and just giving back to the community maybe changing some young kids life by seeing it. You know the good stuff like that, I bought the car late April of 2015 while it was still over seas. Before that the car wasn't advertised anywhere, it was bought from a private seller. The car was bone stock with absolutely nothing done to it, probably just somebodies family car or commuter. Upon arrival, the dealer i bought it from wasn't too happy with how the 25 year old paint job looked so he actually got the whole car painted. Its not a 10k paint job but it's a very presentable paint job, as well he replaced the front seats due to the bolsters being torn. So the front seats are actually out of an R34 GTT. On to the modifications that i did to the car, nothing outrageous or anything. Just your typical HKS intake and blow of valve. A full stainless steel turbo back exhaust, 3 inch straight pipe with a muffler only. Really sounds amazing and very throaty, I have some stage one pro performance coilovers on there that really honestly been a dream of a ride. There's a set of WORK EQUIP wheels on the car, 17x8 and 17x9 +40 with an inch bolt on spacers in the front and a 5mm slip on spacers in the rear. Wheels are wrapped in HANKOOK ventus v12 evo 2, 225 front and 235 rear. On for the interior i have a BOSS Steering wheel adapter with a MOMO mod 08, great wheel. Also installed a fun little boost gauge in the driver side heater duct, looks cool I think. Other than that is a PIONEER double din radio I installed because the factory SONY cd player was inoperable and the stock radio only tunes up to 90fm. Earlier this year i replaced the dashboard. Recently I replaced both rear lower control arms and the gasket from the exhaust manifold to the hot side of the turbo. Oil changes have only been done with Liqui moly, All OEM Nissan parts, thats pretty much it, car drives and runs like a dream with about 117km which is about 72k miles. I'd drive it across country and back having a blast with absolutely no worry in the world for real. Literally the best car I've owned being reliable. I obviously have all the parts and accessories that i took off the car, wheels suspension etc.... Sorry for such a long description but I just wanted to be all clear with everyone. Price is 13k firm, clean title in hand as well as all of the importation documents. Please don't email me since i don't use a smartphone so just call or text me anytime of the day. Pictures go from the start of how it looked in Japan to the progress of my ownership. Also upon purchase i will pay to have the car completely detailed for the new owner Thank you for looking!!

It features 32 MIDAS microphone preamplifiers and 25 time-aligned and phase-coherent mix busses. \n \nMidas M32 Features: \n \nAES50 networking allows up to 96 inputs and 96 outputs \nOpen architecture allows for future 96 kHz operation \n192 kHz ADC and DAC converters for outstanding audio performance \nIndustry-leading design by Bentley Motors Designer \nHigh-performance carbon fiber, aluminium and high-impact steel structure \n40 bit floating point digital signal processing \n8 DCA and 6 mute groups \n8 stereo signal processing effects engines \n25 MIDAS PRO motorized 100 mm faders \nDaylight viewable 7\" full color TFT display screen \n32 x 32 channel USB 2.0 audio interface \nDAW remote control emulations of Mackie Control and HUI protocols \nOptional wireless remote control with MIDAS Apps for iPhone and iPad \nAuto-ranging universal switch-mode power supply \n3-Year Warranty Program (restrictions apply) \nDesigned and engineered in England \nMidas' goal for the M32 was to combine the best of classic British console designs with advanced modern technology to completely redefine what a medium-format live console can offer.  They began the industrial design process by drawing inspiration from a somewhat unexpected source - the luxury and high-performance car industry. \n \nWhy High-Performance Cars? \nSimply, because the design teams at Aston Martin, Bentley, Rolls Royce and other leading manufacturers are skilled at introducing innovative technological advancements while simultaneously maintaining the feel, essence, and intangible qualities of their cherished brands.  And in essence, that's the challenge Midas also faced when creating the M32 console. So in order to create a future-forward design that took the MIDAS legacy even further, they enlisted the help of Rajesh Kutty, a leading industrial designer known for his work with celebrated luxury auto manufacturers such as Bentley, etc. Kutty started by examining the design elements that have made MIDAS consoles so highly sought after - from the straightforward, logical layout to the unparalleled usability and ergonomics.  These are characteristics that live sound engineers around the world have come to rely on, and are key aspects of the MIDAS legacy. With these design elements in mind, Kutty set forth to create a styling that would be modern, innovative, futuristic, and stunningly elegant. Many different construction materials were tested.  Countless design variations were explored.  And in the end, a styling was chosen that represented the perfect marriage between aerodynamic artistry and uncompromising performance.  The design is both ultramodern and distinctly classic at the same time. \n \nThe Landmark in Console History \nA close look at M32 reveals that the styling is completely new in every sense of the word.  Rajesh Kutty's automotive-inspired design elements mesh perfectly with a recognisable MIDAS signature, setting the M32 apart from any other console.  Its beautifully streamlined and elegant form factor completely revolutionises the experience of live mixing. The MIDAS M32 construction is equally impressive, and is designed to offer you years of reliable performance while withstanding the demanding environment of live performance venues.  M32 employs a predominantly space-frame construction, with parts of the sub-frame consisting of durable and lightweight carbon fiber and aluminium.  Multiple alloys have been employed throughout to guarantee maximum component efficiency and an improved performance-weight ratio. The M32 is an innovative, evolved design that brings together modern construction principles and high-tech materials into a styling that's destined to go down as a landmark in console history. \n \nIndustry-Leading 192 kHz Precision \nThe groundbreaking M32 console combines legendary MIDAS sound quality with advanced digital technology, future-proof 96 kHz capable open architecture design and industry-leading 192 kHz ADC and DAC converters, creating a revolutionary mid-format live console.  M32 features ultra-sleek styling, offering you a truly luxurious mixing experience.  High-end construction materials including carbon fibre provide unparalleled durability and strength, plus substantially lower weight than comparable consoles. The M32 utilizes award-winning MIDAS PRO Series microphone preamplifiers and the custom-designed MIDAS PRO motorised faders that are rated for 1 million life cycles-three times more than other leading consoles. The MIDAS M32 is a future-forward console that completely raises the bar for live mixing. \n \nLegendary MIDAS Sound Quality \nWhile the MIDAS M32 design, styling, and construction will surely turn a lot of heads, it's the sound that matters most to engineers and performing artists.  And that's where M32 shines even brighter - as the latest in a long line of pristine-sounding MIDAS consoles, it descends from a celebrated lineage that literally set the standard in electrical design and sound quality.  Ever since MIDAS consoles first found fame 40 years ago with acts like Billy Joel, Yes, The Beach Boys, Pink Floyd and others, the MIDAS legacy has always been about uncompromising quality and the ultimate in sound reproduction. Backing the analog input section are audiophile Cirrus Logic multi-channel 192 kHz capable A/D converters, which boast a 114 dB dynamic range, ensuring impressively low distortion and low noise performance. \n \nBuilt for Tomorrow \nThe M32 is a console built for today, and tomorrow - its future-proof 96 kHz capable open architecture design and industry-leading 192 kHz 24 bit ADC and DAC converters provide outstanding state-of-the-art audio performance. \n \nAward-Winning MIDAS Mic Preamplifier \nThe MIDAS mic preamp is considered by leading live sound and recording engineers to be the very essence of the famous MIDAS sound.  More than 40 years of design experience paired with the finest choice of premium-grade components lead to the acclaimed warmth and depth, bring out subtle ambience, maintain spatial positioning, and more effectively capture a precise image.  The acclaimed sound of the award-winning MIDAS microphone preamplifier has inspired generations of live sound engineers to their best work, creating sonic landscapes that have captivated audiences worldwide. \n \nCreating Sonic Landscapes \nThe MIDAS preamplifier design eliminates typical imbalances of gain-setting stages, thereby improving the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and harmonic distortion to an almost immeasurable level.  The constant high-frequency bandwidth topology assures excellent stability, RF rejection and noise performance at all gain levels, contributing to its transparent, open and dynamic sound.  But it doesn't end there, over the years many mix engineers have found that this robust and overload-tolerant design takes on a whole new dimension of sound when driven hard, the pristine audiophile reproduction giving way to just the right combination of harmonics, a warm and organic sound heard by millions of concertgoers and recorded for posterity on countless live albums over the years. \n \nSince pristine sound always begins with the microphone preamplifier, the first point where your signal enters the console, M32 features genuine MIDAS microphone preamplifiers which faithfully reproduce every sonic detail so no part of a performance will ever be missed.  Transparent and pristine sound, low noise and high common-mode rejection are all hallmarks of this classic design. The microphone preamplifiers are the very same ones used in the industry standard MIDAS XL4 and HERITAGE 3000 consoles, which many consider to be the greatest analogue live consoles ever built.  Over the past decade, the XL4 and HERITAGE 3000 have been utilised by countless top artists including Bon Jovi, Alanis Morrisette, AC/DC, Coldplay, Kid Rock, Metallica, Alicia Keys, Foo Fighters, Christina Aguilera, Sir Paul McCartney, Pearl Jam, and many more. The M32 draws from this same legacy to bring you a professional level of audio quality and performance. \n \nWhat Makes the M32 Possible is Everything \nWhether you come from an analogue mixing background, or are accustomed to using other digital consoles, your first experience with M32 has been engineered to be intuitive, fluid and straightforward. The brilliance of the M32 is its simplicity and workflow.  Tactile controls allow smooth adjustments to critical elements as the mix progresses while the TFT screen keeps you informed every step of the way.  This integration of tactile controls, motorised faders and the array of LCD and TFT displays makes the M32 experience the premiere solution for Live Sound, Broadcast, Studio Recording and Post Production applications. M32 changes the game by completely rethinking what is possible in a digital mixer.  An intuitive workflow coupled with a fully interactive user interface ensures immediate familiarity and instills confidence.  Advanced engineering and meticulous design deliver stellar sonic performance at an extremely affordable price - changing the game entirely. MIDAS' experience spans over 40 years at the very top end of the live audio industry on countless world tours by the greatest artists and the most prestigious events.  40 years of relentless research, development with 300 of the world's best engineers plus complete control over the manufacturing process.  This is what powers the M32. Above all, M32 is designed to put the power of digital in your hands, without compromise.  MIDAS' singular focus on a matchless value proposition means M32 integrates advanced features such as motorised faders, LCD scribble strips, integrated personal monitor mixing and true high-speed digital audio networking as standard features. \n \nYour \"Mind-to-Sound\" Interface \nM32 is your \"mind-to-sound\" interface - the intersection of creativity and production. Whether you're accustomed to digital mixers or not, the M32's intuitive user interface offers a fluid mixing experience that instantly feels like home. From the first moments of use, the workflow unfolds in a way that strips away obstacles, distractions, and hesitation. \n \nElements of Flow \n \nChannel Strip \nThe M32 Channel Strip puts the most important channel processing parameters into one section so that no matter which channel you are working on, the controls are always the same. This highly-efficient layout stems from MIDAS decades of console design and input from our users.  Optimized control illumination ensures a clear indication of levels or status from any viewing angle. Illuminated rotary encoders and switches give you control of preamp settings, frequency shelving, dual dynamics sections, as well as multi-mode fully parametric EQ, bus sends, main, mono and stereo panning. \n \n7\" Main Display \nM32's 7\" day-viewable color TFT (Thin-Film Transistor) display shows the setting parameters you need when you need them. Selected for its high-contrast performance and outdoor visibility, TFT is ideal for concert and open air festival venues.  Flanked by high-precision, context-sensitive tactile encoders, the screen comes to life and immediately reports in high definition all adjustments applied to a wide range of parameters. Intelligent design puts control of vital functions such as Effects, Metering, Routing and much more 1 or 2 button presses away. \n \nSends On Fader \nM32 brings the convenience of digital mixing to your Aux and output bus mixes too, thanks to its integrated Sends on Fader feature.  This incredible function allows you to build powerful, dedicated sub-mixes for monitor, secondary zone feeds, and much more-all without affecting the front of house mix or levels. The M32 allows you to send your choice of signals to any Aux or output bus and then dial in the perfect mix via the channel faders. The console remembers where you set the faders and instantly recalls them when you select a bus for quick adjustments. \n \nDCA Groups \nDCA (Digitally Controlled Amplifier) groups allow control over several signals at once without actually mixing them into a subgroup bus.  M32's 8 DCA groups let you control multiple signals via a single fader, such as the entire drum mix, the horn section, or the backup vocalists, etc. DCA control affects the FOH mix, while allowing the individual buses to remain unchanged.  The result is a customizable workflow that provides maximum flexibility, but still allows individual buses and subgroups to serve the purpose they were intended for, such as zone sends, broadcast feeds, etc. \n \nView Function \nAcross the M32, you'll find 11 strategically-placed View buttons associated with various functions.  These buttons enable immediate access to information about that specific function. For instance, if you press the View button in the Equalizer section, information for that channel's EQ is instantly shown on the main display, providing in-depth editing of all related parameters. This direct access to visual fine-tuning gives the engineer a level of control previously available only on consoles costing exponentially more. \n \nAssign Section \nWhile some digital consoles offer a few user-definable controls, M32's Assign section sets a new standard by providing a total of 36 fully customizable controls on three separate layers. As with channels and buses, individual Scribble Strips are provided for immediate identification.  Buttons can be defined to toggle parameters on/off, adjust timing of effects by tapping, or jump to specific screen views. Rotary encoders with LED collars can be assigned to specific channel parameters, or to additional parameters in the Dynamics section relevant to the current channel selection. \n \n\"Acoustic Integration\" - the Live Sound Revolution \nLegendary 40-year old British company TURBOSOUND, famous for producing some of the world's best speaker systems, have teamed up with MIDAS to seamlessly integrate mixer and speaker systems. We call it \"Acoustic Integration\". The M32's ULTRANET bus allows streaming up to 16-channels of pristine digital audio to an array of TURBOSOUND iQ speakers - all on a single CAT5 cable, along with control data to set sound presets remotely. Furthermore, the iQ Series features \"True Physical Modeling\" of some of the most popular speakers which can be easily remote controlled via the M32, allowing the sound engineer to apply different speaker models in real time from the comfort of the mixing desk. \n \n100-Band RTA for all Channel/Bus EQs \nThe M32 includes a high-resolution 100-band Real Time Analyzer (RTA), with full Bar and Spectrograph views.  This high-resolution RTA displays the audio energy distribution in 100 frequency bands over time - capturing a sonogram window of a full 10 seconds. Switch between the Large RTA view, displaying any available signal in full screen resolution, or the Combined view with the RTA view shown above each of the channel and bus EQ curves.  See the results of your filtering choices in the audio spectrum directly. Additionally, the RTA can be displayed on top of the 31-band graphic EQs in the FX rack. Monitoring and controlling frequencies has never been easier. \n \n16 Breathtaking FX \"Plug-Ins\" Based on True Physical Modeling \nMidas has added 16 FX \"Plug-Ins\" to the M32, giving you access to a total of 50+ effects that would otherwise cost tens of thousands of dollars in hardware. This latest generation of high-end FX \"Plug-Ins\" is based on True Physical Modeling of classic audio hardware.  Midas essentially \"rebuilt\" classic analog gear in the digital domain and included models of legendary processors such as Urei's 1176, Teletronix LA-2A and Fairchild 670 compressors as well as the legendary Pultec EQP-1a and EQ5 equalizers etc.  They also added a cutting-edge 5-band multiband compressor. Last but not least, the M32 can now run 4 studio-quality stereo reverbs together with 8 channels of 31-band graphic EQ.  This allows you to replace your old outboard gear with a fully recallable onboard solution. \n \nGain Splitting and Remote Control for FOH and Monitoring \nA Gain Split mode separates channel gain (trim) from the head amp gain, allowing both the FOH and/or the monitor engineer to adjust local trim digitally - and independently of the preamp gain. Additionally, the HA Gain Remote option allows console gains to be remotely controlled by an external console, such as when using the M32 as a stage box. \n \nMore Routing and Processing Flexibility \nThe M32's routing becomes even more flexible with this recent firmware upgrade.  Output signals and XLR outputs are now treated separately, allowing signals from AES50 sources or expansion cards to be routed directly to the M32's analog outputs. For example, now you can use the outputs from an M32 for directly routing back PA or monitoring signals from a main or FOH console.  Output tap points can be set as pre- or post-mute for greater usability with your P16 personal monitoring mixers.  This is very useful in situations where you don't want mute groups to interrupt your signal flow. \n \nMighty New Tools for Scene and Show Management \nIntroducing the Cue List, an innovative way to automate the loading of scenes and new \"Snippets\" at different points during a show.  Each of the 500 Cue entries can load any of the 100 Scenes or Snippets separately or at the same time.  This gives you an amazing total of 500 Cues x 100 Scenes x 100 Snippets. For example, store your favorite EQ settings for drums on channels 1-8 as a Snippet, recallable in an instant as its own preset, completely independent of the console's overall scene.  It's like taking a snapshot of a parameter on an input, return, FX slot, bus, Matrix, Main or DCA group - and saving it for quick access whenever you need it. \n \nThe MIDAS PRO FADER - Rated for 1 Million Life Cycles \nIn Midas' pursuit to lead the industry in every possible aspect, they decided to design the world's most reliable motor fader.  They dove deep into materials science, employing semi-precious metals that offered the durability they desired.  They took painstaking care to design a motorized fader that would provide continuous performance night after night, year after year. After spending a great deal of time working with metal vendors, Midas developed precision components that offer high linearity, robustness, and smooth feel during operation.  They needed ultra-straight high-grade steel guide rods with smooth polished surfaces-and they got them.  They worked closely with theit manufacturing partners to maintain the tolerance of their parts, always choosing the most suitable materials and controlling the processes to ensure consistent moulding quality and eliminating the warping and deformation caused by shrinking as the parts cool. True, none of this was easy - they spent many long hours developing the MIDAS PRO FADER design.  However, the results speak for themselves. MIDAS PRO FADERS are rated for up to 1,000,000 cycles-three times that of other leading manufacturers. \n \nLCD Scribble Strips \nA total of 29 programmable LCD Scribble Strips offer channel/bus identification that mirrors what is being controlled. Use them to enter input/output tags, plus add icons you recognize at-a-glance.  Then assign colors to create visual groups for immediate, on-the-fly recognition of similar inputs. Simple, elegant and effective - plus you'll never need masking tape again. \n \nVirtual Effects Racks ( See above for images ) \nM32 includes an extensive array of onboard effects, rendering outboard processing racks a thing of the past.  The Virtual FX rack features 8 true-stereo, studio-grade effects engines each assignable to any input, group or output mix bus.  Choose from high-end FX modules including a range of reverbs, delays, EQs, dynamics and much more. \n \nEach FX algorithm has been completely re-imagined for stunning performance - typically costing several times the price of the M32. \n \nCustom-designed, and physically modeled after some of the most iconic and sought-after processors, all effects run inside the low-latency environment of the M32 mix engine, ensuring flawless performance, flexible routing and the end of cable faults forever. \n \nThe immaculate tube signal path in Teletronix' LA-2A Leveling Amplifier has left its exceptional clarity, its rich and warm compression on countless albums of the past decades. \n \nThe ultra-smooth optical attenuator is closely modeled in Midas' LA COMPRESSOR .  It provides breezing, natural and effortlessly musical compression. (Inspired by Teletronix LA-2A.) \n \nWhen Urei released the 1176LN Limiting Amplifier in the late '60s, it broke new ground.  Field Effect Transistors employed were just invented and the 1176 was one of the first audio processors to benefit from this new technology. \n \nMidas' digital re-incarnation, ULTIMO COMPRESSOR , is based on the early Rev. E model and authentically captures the smooth character of the original class-A output stage and its FET's legendary fast Attack. (Inspired by Urei 1176LN.) \n \nThe Fairchild 670 tube compressor not only achieves record bids in high-end vintage gear auctions, it also delivers some of the finest colorations in compressor history.  Two small trim VR's preset the control side chain action, a six-step switch determines the timing, and the two large Input and Threshold knobs adjust the levels. \n \nMidas' FAIR COMPRESSOR model is true to the original signal path, and conveniently provides models for dual, stereo-linked or M/S operation. (Inspired by Fairchild 670.) \n \nThe COMBINATOR is an amazing 5-band compressor that emulates famous broadcasting and mastering compressors. \n \nA highly complex processor, the COMBINATOR utilizes automatic parameter control that produces stunning and \"inaudible\" results.  Makeup-gain for each frequency band will automatically be adjusted by the Spectral Balance Control (SBC) function, to maintain a balanced audio spectrum. \n \nThe XTEC EQ1 is undisputedly one of the best passive studio equalizers ever manufactured.  Virtually indescribable, recording engineers claim the Pultec EQP-1a to be the \"secret sauce\" of sound enhancement. \n \nMidas analyzed this classic to the core and created an exact physical model that reproduces the multi-faceted sound in painstaking detail. Even the transformers and tube output stage have been faithfully modeled. (Inspired by Pultec EQP-1a.) \n  \nPultec simply wrote the book on passive equalization.  By digitally \"rebuilding\" every aspect of the original Pultec classic, Midas captured the very essence in their parametric equalizer XTEC EQ5 .  Their digital re-incarnation is based on the original model and authentically emulates the smooth character of the its rather unique components. (Inspired by Pultec MEQ5.) \n  \nThe SUB OCTAVER provides two channels of earth-shattering sub-harmonics generation, one or even two octaves below the input signal.  While originally designed for bass players, the effect can be adjusted for Hi, Mid and Low frequency tracking to apply to a wide range of applications.  This is your secret weapon for beatboxing. \n  \nThe EDISON EX1 is the re-incarnation of Midas' own analog classics.  This remarkably-effective tool allows manipulation of the stereo field.  Selectable M/S input/output modes allow the processing or creation of M/S recorded sound sources. (Inspired by BEHRINGER EDISON.) \n  \nThe SOUND MAXIMIZER restores natural brilliance and clarity to any audio signal by adjusting the phase and amplitude integrity to reveal more of the natural texture of the sound, which is often hidden when using some effects and equalizers. (Inspired by Sonic Maximizer 482i.) \n  \nThe DIMENSIONAL CHORUS is the perfect emulation of what has been referred to as \"the best analog Chorus unit ever created\".  Four simple Mode preset buttons activate amazing effects, best described as \"space\" and \"dimension\".  Absolutely faithful to the original, multiple preset buttons can be pressed simultaneously. (Inspired by Roland Dimension D Chorus.) \nMODULATION DELAY combines three of the most used time modulation effects into one easy-to-operate unit.  Enjoy true-stereo delay with a lush and spacious chorus, topped off with three reverb models to choose from. \n \nThe Lexicon 480L has been recognized as the gold standard of digital reverb.  We have included three of the finest reverb models - Rich Plate, Room and Rich Chamber .  The M32's models precisely capture all nuances based on Midas' \"True Physical Modeling\" and their algorithms even incorporate the unit's AD/DA gain stepping converters - nailing the entire analog and digital circuit paths right down to the last detail. (Inspired by Lexicon 480L.) \n \nEXCITERS increase presence and intelligibility in live sound applications and are indispensable for adding clarity, air and harmonic overtones in the recording studio.  ENHANCERS let you emphasize the Bass, Midrange and Hi output at selectable frequencies. \n \nYou can generate maximum punch, clarity and detail, without turning up the overall volume. (Inspired by Aphex Aural Exciter and SPL Vitalizer.) \n \nMidas' TruEQ STEREO GEQ delivers musical and responsive signal processing-perfect for general room equalization, indispensable for monitoring.  M32 provides up to 16 mono graphic EQs, in addition to the multi-band parametric EQs in all channels and buses, to cope with the most demanding stage monitoring situation. \n \nPlus, the M32's motorized faders can be switched to control the filter bands of the graphic EQ, with the channel LCDs showing the corresponding filter frequencies-and you can even put this on a user defined hot-key for immediate access. (Modeled after KLARK TEKNIK DN360) \n \nVINTAGE ROOM stands out head and shoulders over other competing reverberation strategies in the way it models sound propagation in air and room resonances.  Invented in the early '80s, the role model delivered authentic room character from an algorithmic reverb long before convolution-based processing was available. \n \nIt is an ideal reverb for mixes or sub-groups, as it adds space to complex signals-highly valued in classical music and broadcasting environments. (Inspired by Quantec QRS.) \n \nPLATE REVERB emulates the characteristics of a plate reverb chamber with control over the damping pad, modulation depth and speed, and crossover.  PLATE REVERB will give your tracks the sound heard on countless hit records since the late 1950s. (Inspired by Lexicon PCM70.) \n \nThe 3-TAP DELAY in the M32 records the input signal and then echoes it back after a user-definable period of time and number of repeats.  What makes the stereo and triple delay useful and outstanding is the linked tap-timing and musical choice of echo patterns. \n \nUse the 3-TAP DELAY to fatten up vocals and instruments, or to add an enhanced spatial element to any performance. \n \nThe HALL REVERB effect provides a broad spectrum of reverberation possibilities, from small room to large, or even cavernous proportions.  When softly mixed with the original signal, Hall Reverb can be used to create a warm, more natural sound. (Inspired by Lexicon 480L.) \n \nThe handy dynamic FLANGER & DELAY duo blends the \"whoosh\" of soaring jet planes with classic Delay, and can be adjusted from mild to wild.  This combination effect only takes up one FX slot. (Inspired by Lexicon PCM70.) \n \nWAVE DESIGNER is a powerful tool for adjusting signal transients and dynamics such as attack and sustain.  Use it to make a snare drum really \"crack\" in the mix or level out volume inconsistencies of slap bass tracks. (Inspired by SPL Transient Designer.) \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_jKiZxLTTXzf_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_hVxZZt5pRey_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_jxLiOvwnKDv_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_haWFTJTAkBz_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "40.706067", "lng": "-73.793707", "postId": "5946715717", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/msd/5946715717.html", "postDate": "2017-01-05T13:07:33-0500", "updateDate": "2017-01-11T11:22:24-0500", "attributes": "new Midas M32", "locAccuracy": "highest", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/msd/5946715717", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:51.472888", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

Not everything shown in the pictures is still available. Read the list of items below for the most up-to-date availability. If you're not sure what an item is you can look it up using the manufacturer's item number listed in the parentheses. \n \nI bought everything for a personal project. Each item was only used on a few dozen shoots and I'm only selling it because the project's done shooting now. Almost every item is under 18-months-old and in very good to excellent condition. \n \nNone of this equipment has ever been used in a photo studio and all of it was bought new by me. I'm very careful with all of my equipment and every item is in better condition than you would get buying used from a photo studio where items are used every day on set. If you want to buy as cheaply as possible go shop somewhere else, I'm sure you can find a heavily beat up version for less somewhere else, but if you want an item in excellent to like new condition with a nice discount to boot this is the best you'll find. So for all those reasons I'm knocking 20% off the list price of every item listed (except where noted). \n \nThe softboxes are very high quality Chimera brand softboxes.

I built this PC with music production in mind, so it has good specs. It has an SSD so if you load the OS on there it'll be real zippy. \n \nWhats good about a PC like this? Its totally modular so if one part breaks all you have to do is go on youtube and replace that part. If a part gets outdated, you do the same thing and replace that one part.  \n \nThis specific model does not have a super crazy graphics card since Im not much of a gamer, so I dropped the price to compensate for that.  \n \nSpecs: \nCase \nNZXT \n- Room for six hard drives \n- Room for 3 CD drives \n- Very spacey as you can see in the pictures \n- Water cooling capable \n- is quiet but cools really well \n \nMotherboard \n- asus z87 pro \n- Room for 4 sticks of RAM  \n- Decent built in graphics card (but if you game you're gonna want to get a better card) \n \nProcessor  \n- Intel i7 4790 3.6ghz (this was top of the line when I got it, but it's still probably more processing power than you'll need) \n- fan included  \n \nRAM  \n-8gb (two more slots in the motherboard), but 8 is more than enough for day to day use \n \nStorage \n-1 terabyte HDD (Western digital)  \n-250 GB SSD (Samsung) (install the operating system on here \ud83d\udc4c) \n \nPower Supply \n-Its in there works, should last for years \n \nLet me know if you have any questions about anything and I'll be happy to answer what I can.

Part Number: GT050Q1F-250 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \nPHYSICAL CONDITION:  *TESTED and Works GREAT!  \n\"Fully Functioning Unit\". Mint Condition as shown.  \nThe HARD DRIVE is currently Formatted for a MAC but can also be used on a PC. 2 UNITS ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR SALE. \nThe 250GB Quad Interface Hard Drive from Glyph-Technologies is an external hard drive in a GT-050 desktop enclosure. It can connect to your computer via the FireWire-800, FireWire-400, USB 2.0, or eSATA interface. The drive is designed by Glyph for use in professional audio applications. \nThe enclosure is constructed from stainless steel and features tri-laminate sound-damping to help reduce noise. This makes the drive an ideal solution for storage in audio and video production environments. \nQuad interface connects via FireWire-800, FireWire-400, USB 2.0, or eSATA  \n250GB allows for storage of approximately 18.75 hours of uncompressed DV digital video, the equivalent of 53 4.7GB DVD video discs, or up to 62,500 MP3 files. \nTri-laminate sound damping technology makes the drive ideal for audio production and video editing.  \nThe drive mechanism features a 8MB data buffer, 8ms seek time, and 70MB/sec sustained transfer when connected via eSATA. \nWhy do you need the rock-solid Glyph GT 050Q 250GB? We'll tell it to you straight. Skimping out and choosing a crappy hard drive is like buying a hot new car and giving it a set of tires that are about to bust. You would NEVER risk your car breaking down over a set of tires you know are going to kick it. So why would you let your entire recording and creative rig depend on a piece of crap, plastic drive that can't hang with your demands? For about the same price, you can get the Glyph GT 050Q 250GB. And it's so worth it. \n \nThe Glyph GT 050Q 250GB hard drive was actually designed for pro audio and pro video. Not only is it super fast (7,200 RPM), with a big cache (up to 8MB), and loaded with a ton of connectivity on the back for working in practically any studio setup (FireWire 400, FireWire 800, USB 2.0, and eSATA)  \nIf you want our opinion, the GT 050Q 250GB, and all Glyph hard drives, are the best, most dependable digital storage media we can get our hands on. It's as simple as that.   \nHow else does the Glyph GT 050Q 250GB have you covered? It's qualified to work with all of the pro audio applications you know and use today -- and the ones you're going to want to use tomorrow. And thanks to the Oxford 924 bridging chip, Pro Tools is also on this Glyph's list of qualified-to-work-with DAWs. You can rack mount the GT 050Q 250GB, so you can free up desktop space in your studio -- or use it as a part of your on-the-go rig. The ears are optional, and really affordable (Not included). To wrap it up, the GT 050Q 250GB features an ultra-quiet fan. Don't even worry about having live mics in the same room as the GT 050Q 250GB. This thing is practically silent and totally reliable -- two things creative pros have to have.  \nAre you getting the picture? Serious recording demands require a real-deal hard drive that can meet the needs without risking failure. That's why you choose the Glyph GT 050Q 250GB.  \nGlyph GT 050Q 250GB Hard Drive Features at a Glance: \nPro audio Hard Drive \nConnections: FireWire 800 and 400, USB 2.0, and eSATA \nHard Drive Size: 250GB \nUltra-quiet operation \nOxford 924 bridging chip for optimized use with Pro Tools \nProduct Highlights: \n-GT-050 Table-Top Enclosure \n-eSATA \n-FireWire-800 \n-FireWire-400 \n-USB 2.0 \n                                                        \n \n                                                                       Performance  \nCapacity  250GB   \nInterface  1x eSATA Connector \n1x 6-Pin FireWire-400 Connector \n2x 9-Pin FireWire-800 Connectors \n1x USB 2.0 Connector   \nDrive Speed  7200rpm   \nBuffer  8MB   \nAverage Seek Time  8ms   \nSustained Data Transfer Rate  eSATA: 70MB/sec \nDrivers:  \nSupported  Not Required   \nIncluded  Not Required   \n                                                                                                    \n \n                                                              System Requirements: \nMac  Operating System: Mac OS 8.6, 9.x, or Mac OS X 10.x   \nWindows  Operating System: Windows 7, 98SE, Me, XP, 2000, Vista,8.1   \nHardware  FireWire-400, FireWire-800, USB 2.0, or eSATA Port  \nGeneral Information:  \nMounting  Desktop \nOptional Rack mount kit available (Not included in this Sale)   \nPower Requirements  AC: 100-240VAC, 50/60Hz   \nEnvironmental Requirements: \nOperating Temperature: 41-131\u00b0F (5-55\u00b0C) \nHumidity: 30-80%, non-condensing \nStorage Temperature: -40-149\u00b0F (-40-65\u00b0C) \nHumidity: 10-90%   \nDimensions (WxHxD)  8.6 x 1.7 x 9.5\" (21.8 x 4.3 x 24.1cm)   \nWeight  4.3 lb (2kg)   \nItems Included in Sale as follows: \n(1) Glyph Technologies 250GB GT-050Q Quad Interface Hard Drive  \n(1) IEC Power Cable  \n (1) 9-Pin to 9-Pin FireWire-800 Cable  \n(1) Hard Drive CASE as shown in Pictures \nCUSTOMER TO NOTE: THERE ARE CURRENTLY (2) TWO UNITS AVAILABLE FOR SALE.  \nPLEASE FEEL FREE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING RELATED TO THIS LISTING. \n \nThank You for stopping by and Have a Great Day!   \n \n  \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_6zgs1GOloUc_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_bFQsnsJgMNa_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00101_gV0k977gnCL_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_doh0TMw1MZB_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00101_gtYjDFxctah_600x450.jpg"], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5948493598", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/sop/5948493598.html", "postDate": "2017-01-06T16:47:18-0500", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "excellent", "locAccuracy": "medium", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/sop/5948493598", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:56.983848", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "2001 Clk320", "price": "1", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Bay Ridge", "description": "\n         \n2001 Clk320 \nSilver Exterior- 8.5/10 (Couple of small flaws but still alot of life left. Had it professionally detailed and waxed so every time you get a car wash the car comes out looking like a mirror) \nBlack Interior-9/10 (Small Rip in the drivers seat right where the left shoulder would be. Seems to be common on these cars) \n75k and change. Miles will go up slowly since it is my daily driver \n \nI am the second owner of the car. The original owner was an older man from Ohio. Since Ive had the car in the past 4 months I have done ALOT of maintenance. Not that it was necessary but I like to take care of my cars because then they take care of you and you never have to worry about any issues.  \n \nSince owning it I have changed all 12 spark plugs and put in high end Bosch Platinum Iridium 4 plugs. \nI had the upper gasket pulled and resealed (usually a common problem that this tends to leak so had it done before it became a problem) \nALL BRAND NEW suspension completely replace with OEM Mercedes parts \nFresh Oil change done 2x since Having the car. I did it when i got the car then fresh oil was put in again when I did the gasket. So maybe only 1500 miles on the oil. \n4 Brand new All Season Continental Extreme Contact Pro tires (mounted and balanced) great for snow, rain etc. \nFixed and changed both fog lights \nUpgraded Hid Headlights- Brighter and Better vision \nInterior and Exterior professionally detailed \nCar has an aftermarket Pioneer Radio with USB & Aux \nPre wired for amp set up- Has RCA and remote wire ran to the trunk. Has power wire & ground in trunk as well  \nBattery was replaced about 4 months ago.  \n \nWindows were tinted out to 20%  \nAc was completely dumped and fresh Freon was put in and topped off. Ac will freeze you out of the car.  \nBrand new Ac filter was put in.  \nAll fluids were checked, and were either changed or topped off if needed \nTiming chain and Water pump are in perfect working order. Was not changed by me but you can tell was changed at some point. 0 play in the timing belt. \n \nHas Heated Seats you can cook an omelette on \nHeat works great!  \n \nThis car has NO issues mechanically. Drove it from Brooklyn to Deep NJ (Jersey Shore) and drove like a dream. Felt like a brand new 2016 car. Only reason for selling is I have no money for a secondary vehicle and I really need a truck. So selling this to catch up on bills and hopefully find myself a good running truck. Bring your mechanic take a look at the car. I have nothing to hide. Im sure im also forgetting a couple of things that i did to it.  \n \nAsking 6,450 obo. EXTREMELY clean overall and drives like a dream! \n \nI paid 5k for the car a couple of months ago and probably about another 5k in maintenance into the car.

{"title": "2005 Subaru Impreza WRX STi", "price": "17000", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Patterson", "description": "\n         \nUp for sale is an Aspen White 2005 Subaru Impreza WRX STi. I am the 3rd owner of the car, the last guy just bought it from his dad. Never owned by a teenager. This car has been meticulously taken care of and it is mechanically sound and will be for a long time to come. I HAVE ALL SERVICE RECORDS AND RECEIPTS. It just passed New York State Inspection in August. This care has been tastefully modified with longevity in mind. For that reason, it has not been raced, tracked, or launched. The odometer reads 127K with about 26K on a new OEM STi block from Subaru after a blown gasket. The number will continue to go up as this is my daily driver. The turbo was replaced with a new oem one around the same time. Shifts smoothly through all six gears and pulls hard everytime. Reason for selling is that I want something a little more comfortable. Don't take that the wrong way, I love this car and it's a blast to drive, I just think it's time for a change. Here is a list of what you need to know. \n \n \nMaintenance: \nOil changed every 3-5K \nNew Timing Belt less than 3K \nNew Water Pump less than 3K \nNew Thermostat less than 3K \nNew Injectors less than 3K \nNew Walbro 255 Fuel Pump less than 5K \nBrake Fluid were bled and flushed less than 2K \nCoolant was flushed less than 2K \nPower Steering fluid was flushed less than 2K \nTransmission Oil was flushed less than 2K \nDifferential Oil was flushed less then 2K \nTires were rotated less then 2K \nPremium NGK Iridium Spark plugs installed less than 15K \n \nMods: \nWeisco Forged Pistons \nGrimspeed EBCS \nMishimoto Aluminum Radiator \nInvidia Catless Downpipe \nPro Drive Axel Back Exhaust \nHKS Turbo Timer \nTune from EFI Logics  \nKartboy Bushings everywhere you can put them \nFeal Performance Suspension all around \nWinter Tires with one winter on them \nRally Armor Mud Flaps \nStoptech Slotted Rotors \nHawk HPS Pads \nBrembo Calibers \nKenwood Sound Head Unit \nCobb Access Port \nJDM Tail Light Pattern \nLightwerks Custom HID Headlights \nTrunk Swap (Wingless) \nComes with Primered Front Lip, Side Skirts, and Rear Spats that I never got to install \nAnd perhaps a few more things I forgot \n \nBad: \nA few dents and dings from the City life. \nTear in Steering Wheel \n \nSelling for 17,000 OBO. Open to trades. I'm looking for someone to take care of this like I have. Best way to reach me is email or text. I work full time 8-5 so be patient.

{"title": "SABA AIR commercial appliances  Brand new freezers refrigerators preps", "price": "2090", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "USA", "description": "\n         \n \n  \n \nI Sell at very low prices and the manufactures do not allow me to put the prices in adds (it upsets other restaurant equipment dealers!) BUT YOU CAN CALL ME my cell is 310 292-1182 and I can give you the price I can sell to you at delivered to you. Many times customers tell me they were quoted for used items more than I am selling them a new one for. Many times a new one is cheaper than the repair cost of your old unit.\n  \n \nI SHIP FROM MANY WAREHOUSE'S ACROSS USA\n  \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n \nI am one of the very largest sellers of SABA AIR in the USA. I know refrigeration and cooking equipment very well. I can help guide you to the correct piece of equipment you need. When you share with me information on your business I can guide you to the right size and piece of equipment you will need. I am knowledgeable on many manufactures of equipment and the pros and cons of different units.\n  \n \nLet's WALK THRU AN EXAMPLE\n  \n  \nLet's use an example that you have a 1600 square feet sit down restaurant with 40 seats, serve beer and wine, serve bistro style food and have a 10' hood what should the equipment be under the hood and what size refrigeration items. Assuming a 10' hood you are required to have 6\" clearance on left and right side of hood unless you have walls on both sides at end of hood so without walls you have 9' to use on equipment. We will start with a typical layout 3' for stove with 6 burners and oven with 36\" salamander on top of stove, 16\" for fryer 40 pound (if cooking frozen fries go to 50 pound), 36\" char grill (use radiant for clean burn, char rock for flavor), 18\" single or double pot stove. This is your 9' of equipment change menu or style and length of hood and equipment will change. If you need griddle we can shorten char broiler and eliminate pot stove or go to 24\" range or cook top. On refrigeration you would need at least 48\" in sandwich/ salad prep refrigeration normal would be 72\" if you have room in walkways go with Mega for more food pans (mega is 7\" deeper front to back). Should have a 2 door freezer (I prefer bottom mount compressor) but depending on items may get by with 1 door freezer. On refrigeration a small walk in 6' by 6' is best but at least a 3 door refrigerator bottom mount compressor. On bar you have several choices I would need to talk with you to make recommendations. There are many things to discuss from type of chair and layout and so on. I can provide more than just to sell you an item.\n  \n \nLet's TALK REBATES\n  \n   \nAcross the USA many utility companies offer excellent rebates on many of the products we sell for being energy star. Rebates run from $50 to $600 on refrigeration/ freezer items. For example Edison offers on stainless solid door freezers $300 for a 2 door and $600 for a 3 door, on glass door freezers they offer $500 for 2 door. Rebates are easy to apply for and it is nice to get funds from utility company. Call us on more details.\n   \n  \nSHOULD I BUY NEW OR USED?\n   \n  \nIt is always nice to save money what about good used equipment? Many refrigerators will last up to 20 years but I consider the life span to be 10 years so if a unit is 10 to 15 years old there is no real value for the unit even if it is working today and if it is 8 years old you may get some use out of it. It is common that a customer will tell me they found a 2-year-old 2 door freezer for $2000. When I look up the serial numbers it may be 15 plus years' old I find it not to be working properly and really no value. On working correctly, they say it cools down, but working and working correctly can be a BIG difference. For a freezer it must reach 0 degrees to negative 10 degrees, on refrigerator it must be between 33 degrees and 40 degrees. So a freezer at 10 degrees and refrigerator at 45 degrees are working but will not pass health inspection. When you buy used they usually don't have a warranty, you have to arrange transport. If it is only a couple years old and it is super cheap you can consider it, but please do not pay a lot for an old unit that may be full of headaches. Many times I am able to sell a NEW unit at a similar price to what others will sell used AND it has full warranty. \n   \n  \n   \n  \n \nGENE SHOOK RESTAURANT EQUIPMENT  \n12583 Crenshaw Blvd  \nHawthorne, CA 90250  \n \nPhone: 310 292-1182  \nweb: www.shooksales.com  \n \n \nATOSA , mixers, mixer, oven, ovens, slicer, slicers, pizza preptable, sandwich prep table, megatop, coil, compressor, remote, walk in box, cooler, coolers, freezer, freezers, alto shaam, alto sham, cook and hold, pie press, proofer, proofers, Hobart, Baxter, revent, rotisserie, ice machine, ice machines, bakery racks, rack, conveyor, pan washer, pan washers, comtec, dutchess, dough divider, adamatic, rack oven, single, double, meat grinder, 1 door, 2 door, stainless steel, aluminum, bakery case, deli case, pastry, case, display case, dessert case, tables, equipment stands, sheet pans, muffin pan, pita oven, spiral mixer, dough sheeter, delfield, beverage air, everest, Columbus, federal, combitherm, hoshizaki, true, amana, salamander, cheese melter, glass door, food proccesor, tandoori oven, flat bread, bagel, deep fryer, griddle, stove, 6 burner, 4 burner, convection, dual temp, henny penny, pressure fryer, dough pro, savory toaster, manitowoc, yogurt machine, taylor, sink, sinks, hood, hoods, self contained, charbroiler, smoker, southern pride, bbq, barbeque, juice machine, orange juicer, blender     ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_etmo8IQYn4e_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_96RAQ85SE9m_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_j5lypryGM9U_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_3UZ66lfVMZn_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_eMtaEtF5iP4_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01414_fzmEGHACjrH_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_axdUzOpEpsa_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_q9haDGV9HB_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_8snn1qCsNJa_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_5HQ9U2ZcAaY_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_jwajYT87X1x_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_kcga56hftUr_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_7Btq5eou3fI_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01212_F5yQGkG3lW_600x450.jpg"], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5944504394", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/bfd/5944504394.html", "postDate": "2017-01-03T21:54:11-0500", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "new SABA AIR", "locAccuracy": "medium", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/bfd/5944504394", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:07:05.788775", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "2013 Honda CBR250R (With ABS)", "price": "3300", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Park Slope/Crown Heights", "description": "\n         \nSup CL, I'm selling my 2013 Honda CBR250r (ABS) motorcycle, with the rare black/black color combo which was only available from Honda on the 2013-2014 models. The motorcycle is in amazing condition, and has been stored in a secure professional parking garage, and has been covered with a Nelson-rigg bike cover whenever it was not being ridden. Only reason I'm selling the bike is because this was my first bike, had it since July 2016 and was ready for something a little more powerful, so I just upgraded to a 2015 Suzuki GSX-R 600, and don't see the sense of having two motorcycles. This is literally the best first motorcycle a person can buy, it is also amazing for commuting, I literally average around 66-71mpg with this bike, and even though my GSX-R 600 is faster, i still ride this bike more, because its comfortable, light as a feather, and fun as hell when you get it in the 6000-8000 rpm range. The bike has never been dropped, tipped over, nor abused. The oil was just changed, aswell as the chain was just inspected, cleaned, and lubed by KING CYCLES late November 2016. The bike does have a Pro-Grip Tank Pad to protect the bike from scratches when your riding in a leaned over position, aswell as a aftermarket 2Bros Carbon Fiber Black Series exhaust slip-on, which was professionally installed by KING CYCLES, and a Perilli Sport Demon rear tire (one of the best motorcycle tires) with plenty of life in them . The bike will also come with the original exhaust, even though I don't recommend putting it back on because it's very quiet, and New York has some of the worst drivers I've ever came across. For new riders, please get a motorcycle with ABS, it will protect you from idiots on the road, and potentially save your life, please don't listen to people saying you don't need ABS, take it from someone who's been riding motorcycles for 7 months now, ABS has saved my ass more than I can count from bad drivers, and bad roads. It's well worth the extra money. The motorcycle has a clean title, and only has 1,140 miles but will go up, since I still ride it whenever we get nice weather. The bike comes with 2 keys, a Nelson-rigg bike cover, a yellow brake disc lock (w/Key), and the original Honda exhaust slip-on. The bike does not need anything but a new owner, you won't even need to buy gas, because it will have a full tank of gas when it's sold. The price is non-negotiable, I'm not desperate for money, or to sell the bike. Thanks for checking my baby out,  Happy New Years to all! Please Note: For your safety, aswell as my bike's safety I will be the one test riding the bike while you follow behind me.

Larger Red/Green/Blue sub-pixel color areas within the panel create a picture that rivals LED-LCD TVs for brightness. To further improve the already impressive picture, the Super Contrast Panel combines two key innovations for enhanced black levels and color reproduction \n \nReal Black Pro II: Through technology advancement to both the hardware and software of the TV, you can now experience a richer picture quality with deeper blacks, bolder color, and higher contrast.

Witness the entire RGB spectrum brought to life on your screen to bring you exceptionally vibrant, yet natural-looking images faithful to the director's original intent. \nClear Image Technology: The Samsung F8500 series Plasma TV employs two advanced Clear Image technologies which help eliminate blurring caused by off-axis viewing or fast motion video. \n \nSingle Layer Panel: The Plasma TV employs a single layer panel structure which eliminates the production of dual images and blurring, especially at off angled viewing. \n600Hz Subfield Motion: The Samsung F8500 series Plasma TV generates a frame of video at 600 times per second. The result is smoother images with unprecedented picture quality, especially beneficial when viewing sports and fast action movies. \nCinema Smooth Plus: Movies are shot at 24 fps (frames per second); Cinema Smooth Plus is a refined playback process of 24p movies from Blu-ray and Satellite TV sources that accurately converts and displays content originally shot on film at 24fps as compared to the 30fps of DVD and Blu-ray disc. This allows for smoother motion scenes when watching sources shot at the standard movie rate of 24fps. \n \nHDTV Tuner: The TV has built-in over-the-air HDTV (ATSC) and Digital Cable (QAM) tuners, so you don't need a separate set-top box to receive and decode over-the-air HDTV/SDTV or unencrypted Digital Cable signals. \n \n1080p Resolution: The Samsung F8500 series Plasma TV displays all inputs at a resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080).

All HDMI inputs support x.v.Color, Deep Color, 3D, and CEC. The HDMI 3 input also supports the ARC function. The HDMI 4 input is MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link) compliant. In addition, any HDMI input can be used to connect a PC to this TV. \nComponent Video: The Plasma TV features a single component video input. The TV's component video input can also be used as a composite video input (480i only). \nHDMI (MHL) Port: The HDMI 4 port is designed for the connection of select mobile phones and other portable electronic devices using the new MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link) standard. Simply plug your MHL compatible smartphone into the TV's HDMI 4 (MHL) port using the HDMI cable that is included with your mobile phone. MHL allows you to display full 1080p video and still images on the Samsung TV from your mobile smartphone. The TV's IR remote can be used to control basic playback functions (such as Play/Pause, Stop Fast Forward/Rewind, and Menu navigation). Your MHL compliant device will also charge while connected to the TV's HDMI 4 port. To find MHL-certified devices, go to www.mhlconsortium.org. \n \nFull HD 3D (via HDMI 1.4): The Samsung F8500 series Plasma TV offers Full HD (1080p) 3D capability.

The Samsung F8500 series Plasma TV offers various 3D modes to match your 3D viewing needs. \n \n2D-3D: Changes a 2D image to 3D; you can adjust the focus and depth of the image to maximize 3D experience. \nSide-by-Side: Displays two images next to each other.

{"title": "Line6 Pod HD500X", "price": "250", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Upper East Side", "description": "\n         \nThis HD500X has been lightly used and never gigged. It's a great FX processor but I have too much gear and we just moved to a new Manhattan apartment so a bunch of stuff has to go.  \n \nHere is a link to a video about the HD500X: \n \n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZJMSEZcS5o \n \nAnd here is the generic description of the HD500X from Guitar Center:  \n \nThe POD HD500X is the ultimate tone palette, whether you want to re-create classics or go somewhere new with the ability to recall up to 512 totally different rigs-with changes to preamp type, power amp configuration, guitar type, polyphonic alt-tuning, effects chain and more. And thanks to HD technology, POD HD500X provides the depth, character and touch nuance to inspire your creativity in the studio or on stage. So if you've never experienced the flagship of the POD family, now's the time to check out POD HD500X. \n \nWorld-Class HD Amps \nFrom vintage classics to modern powerhouses, each HD amp delivers incredible sonic depth, character and touch nuance to inspire your playing-and that's just the beginning. Customize the tone and dynamic response of each HD amp with an extensive set of deep parameters including Sag, Bias, Bias Excursion, Hum and more. \n \n100+ Studio and Stomp Effects \nPOD HD500X gives you over 100 studio and boutique stomp effects, so you can take your sound in any direction. Emulate classic signal chains with distortions, delays, mods, filters, reverbs and more, or discover entirely new sounds by mixing and matching up to eight simultaneous effects. You also get pro-grade, assignable footswitches and a built-in, die-cast expression pedal to control your effects in real time. \n \nMore Processing Power, More Creativity \nWith unparalleled flexibility and more processing power than anything in its class, POD HD500X is built for tone creation. To start, POD features dynamic DSP, so you have the freedom to stack the effects you want wherever you want them. Compared to its predecessor, POD HD500X lets you add even more effects to your signal chain. You can also mix and match HD amps, cabinets, mics and effects in virtually endless combinations. With 512 presets, you've got plenty of options for recalling your tones. \n \nSculpt Sounds with Dual Signal Paths \nLegendary guitar tones are often created with more than one signal path. POD HD500X lets you create these complex, rich tones without the setup headaches of traditional dual-amp rigs. You can route your guitar through two completely independent paths-each with its own HD amp and effects chain, of course-or process two signals at once using the 1/4\" guitar, 1/4\" auxiliary or XLR mic inputs. So whether you want to configure elaborate signal chains for more traditional stereo amp setups, or create unique soundscapes, you've picked the right tool. \n \nAssignable Footswitches and Rugged Construction \nWith POD HD500X, you get professional-grade footswitches with bright LED rings for at-a-glance operation. You can use them to enable or bypass amps and effects, or to select presets directly. If you want to get more creative, you can assign multiple amp and effects parameters to the expression pedal and morph between sounds-controlling up to 52 parameters in real time. The footswitches also control the built-in 48-second looper-an instrument unto itself. The bent-metal chassis and rugged construction make POD HD500X ideal for any stage. \n \nFlexible I/O for Recording with Any DAW \nPOD HD500X provides all the connections you need for studio, stage and anywhere in between. You can plug in a mic to record vocals or acoustic instruments, track with your favorite HD amps, use the stereo FX loop to connect stompboxes and outboard effects, and much more. Connect to your computer via USB for multi-channel, studio-quality recording with your favorite DAW software-or tap into POD HD Edit, the free editor/librarian software that makes it easy to tweak and organize all your tones. \n \nCommand Center for Your Guitar Experience \nIt doesn't matter if you use a guitar amp, go straight to the PA or take advantage of a next-gen full-range guitar rig-POD HD500X is the ideal command center for any guitar setup. It's a fully assignable MIDI controller, so you can use the footswitches and expression pedal to control all kinds of external hardware and software-and it gets even better when you use POD HD500X with other Line 6 gear. \n \nFeatures: \n \nExtensive collection of award-winning HD amps for authentic tone and feel \n100+ studio and stomp effects\"use up to eight simultaneously \nSelectable speaker cabinets and mics \nUnparalleled flexibility to craft your tones: Dual signal paths, multiple routing optionso Dynamic DSP with more power for amps and effects and stereo FX loop can be inserted anywhere in the signal chain \nProfessional-grade footswitches with bright LED rings for at-a-glance operation \nComprehensive I/O includes USB 2.0, MIDI, S/PDIF, balanced XLR outputs, integrated mic preamp and more \nGuitar input with variable impedance \nFully assignable MIDI controller\"control external hardware and software via footswitches and expression pedal \nL6 LINK connection for integration and control of DT-series amplifiers and StageSource series loudspeakers \nVDI connection for integration and control of James Tyler Variax guitars \n8 set lists containing 64 presets \n512 user-writable preset locations \nAssignable expression pedal controls amp and effect parameters \nIntegrated 48-second looper with dedicated footswitch \nBuilt-in chromatic tuner \nTap-tempo footswitch \nProfessional-grade construction with bent metal chassis, chrome roll bar and die-cast expression pedal    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": "40.773000", "lng": "-73.956600", "postId": "5952568163", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/msg/5952568163.html", "postDate": "2017-01-09T18:42:55-0500", "updateDate": "2017-01-10T23:52:38-0500", "attributes": "excellent Line6 Pod HD500X", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/msg/5952568163", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:07:16.172523", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

Also, Pro-Tip tapered tip and tail enhances mobility of this board, while Frostbite Edges help you really dig in in the ice.

Never taken out of the apartment.  Great effects!  Battery operated or with power supply. \n \nhttp://www.musiciansfriend.com/amplifiers-effects/boss-me-80-guitar-multi-effects-pedal \n \nPacked with tons of awesome BOSS effects and ready to hit the stage, the ME-80 is the perfect compact tone processor for gigging guitarists. A user-friendly, knob-based interface makes it quick and easy to dial in great sounds, with the flexibility of individual stompbox-style on/off or instant recall of complex multi-effects setups. Unique footswitches deliver even more control than previous designs for efficient and intuitive effects switching, patch selection, and realtime sound shaping while playing. It also includes free BOSS TONE STUDIO software to help you unlock even more tonal possibilities, plus a web connection to BOSS TONE CENTRAL for direct access to free patches created by pro guitarists and much more. \n \nFind your own personal sound with the ME-80s extensive range of built-in effects. A complete history of gig-ready BOSS tone processing is at your command, from multiple overdrives and distortions to wahs, mod effects, pitch shifters, delays, and beyond. BOSS groundbreaking Multi-Dimensional Processing (MDP) technology is represented with the unique, spacious ambience of Tera Echo and the distinctive tone-shaping possibilities of Overtone. Updated COSM preamps include new additions such as Crunch and Metal, plus an AC preamp designed for acoustic/electric guitar. \n \nUnlike typical menu-driven multi-effects processors that are complicated and unintuitive, using the ME-80 is as easy as using a stompbox. Effects are organized into eight logical categories that can all be active at the same time. Seven categories contain multiple effects types to choose from, plus dedicated knobs for selecting a type and adjusting it with a set of parameters youd find in the pedal version of the effect. The Pedal FX category has its own knob for quickly assigning a particular effects type or function to be controlled by foot with the expression pedal. You can even save all the current knob settings to one of the ME-80s 36 user patch locations. \nThe hands-on experience that stomp box control provides is perfect for tweaking tones as you go. In Manual mode, the categories function like individual stomp effects, with instant adjustment via the panel knobs and on/off control with dedicated footswitches. By entering Memory mode, seven footswitches are automatically reconfigured to select user or preset patches and patch banks, letting you recall complete multi-effects setups directly. One footswitch on the ME-80 is dedicated just for mode switching, so you can toggle between Manual and Memory modes any time you want. \nFEATURES \nCompact and powerful floor multi-effects with a simple knob-based interface \nEight simultaneous effects categories, each with multiple effects types \nDial up tones with the ease of using your favorite stompboxes \nIncludes a massive selection of top-quality effects, from classic BOSS stomps to the latest MDP effects \nUpdated flagship-level COSM amps derived from the GT-100 \nEight multifunction footswitches and expression pedal \nManual mode for stomp box-style on/off; Memory mode for switching complete patch setups \nDelay section includes Phrase Loop function with 38 seconds of recording \nRuns on six AA batteries or optional PSA-series AC adapter \nUSB audio/MIDI interface built in \nFree BOSS TONE STUDIO software allows you to edit and organize tones on your computer, and also preview and download free patches directly from the BOSS TONE CENTRAL website    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": "40.725500", "lng": "-73.998300", "postId": "5932761884", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/msg/5932761884.html", "postDate": "2016-12-25T20:18:00-0500", "updateDate": "2017-01-11T23:37:27-0500", "attributes": "BOSS ME-80", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/msg/5932761884", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:07:17.159794", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "1968 Ford Thunderbird Rare Tripple Black 429 Thunderjet Coupe", "price": "22999", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Midtown", "description": "\n         \nI am selling my 1968 Ford T-Bird Tripple Black Coupe. This is a matching number vehicle from top to bottom inside and out. Has been family owned since it was brand new. It has really been a blast to own and has always been a turn key type of car with no issues at all. Can easily and effortlessly be driven cross country. This Thunderbird turns heads everywhere it goes and gets compliments all the time. Thunderbird collectors or enthusiasts Do Not let this bird fly away without at least taking a look at this one. This car is in Showroom condition. Winner of numerous trophies from various car shows. No Bubbles No Chips No Rust No Scratches No Dings No Waves and most definitely No Bondo. The Engine is a 429 4V Thunderjet Motor with A.C. and power steering with power brakes. The Interior is jet black with bucket seats in excellent condition with no rips or torn material. The stainless steel trim in the interior has never been dinged or faded or scratched. Has the original telescopic tilt away steering wheel. Has Cobra Snakeskin exterior roof. Front and rear interior and exterior power vents still work as they should. This T-Bird has been well taken care of since it was brand new from day 1. Never smoked in and owned by non smokers. Never driven in the rain never mind the snow. Always kept inside a climate controlled garage and used during summer months only. Original owner was extremely anal on keeping up with maintenance service and has always been serviced at the local Ford dealership and always hand washed the car. Never been to a car wash. I am not car dealer I am a collector/enthusiast/hobbyist who enjoys these type of cars. Today you could not fully restore a car like this for my asking price. Never mind trying to find a good clean one to begin with. These type of cars in this type of condition are getting extremely harder and harder to find. If you do not believe me do some research and you will see there is less than a handful of 1968 Tripple Black 429 Thunderjet coupes for sale. They are extremely rare to find in this color combo. Vehicle is located in Boston Mass off I-95 and I will assist in shipping worldwide. If interested please feel free to email me through the eBay email service or call me direct at Six One Seven Four Eight Three Zero Five Zero Two and I will be happy to answer any questions you might have. No Disappointments here. Had a few say \"Yea but it is not a suicide 4 door\" Well if you want 4 suicide doors then go check out a 60s Lincoln not a Thunderjet coupe. These pictures do not do the car any justice at all. Actually they totally suck. Must be seen in person and driven to really appreciate it. Thanks for looking and best of luck on your classic car search. Price is Negotiable and Trades will be considered for a pre 1972 \nClassic Car Muscle Car Hot Rod Street Rod Pro Street Lead Sled. \n \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00R0R_3RkwpR0G8oq_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_6SKN0DGAAqV_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_l68kyAX4s94_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00000_9pfteLeDQFg_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_6wq6cWlxygv_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_eHEiZuN5CiW_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_6AGQp4WD0mc_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00o0o_ff0tqxB2VZg_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_ihPbXwydIES_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_2l3xI5KwWIh_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01515_4JIdzELWRDo_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_cxhONaH3RWP_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01717_a9QOPCHZlUd_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_aqUSdaU90yn_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00o0o_aKLkg3JoC7J_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_9lXdiAJKD0H_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_eqrzvHkId11_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01717_e5CSBCtQ3wU_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00808_9qFc8edolpN_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_aPfisxXVv02_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01212_Bol9cO7wDl_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_4JX97pZXfJG_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_k1YHRxJBvWr_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00606_bFlyej2xnZx_600x450.jpg"], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5945514134", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/cto/5945514134.html", "postDate": "2017-01-04T15:41:57-0500", "updateDate": "2017-01-12T09:14:24-0500", "attributes": "1968 Ford Thunderbird 1968 429 4BBL like new 8 cylinders rwd gas 61000 black full-size clean automatic coupe", "locAccuracy": "medium", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/cto/5945514134", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:07:18.335950", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

You can probably pick up a used entry level/intermediate transmitter for under $50, which will control any vehicles you purchase in the future, so you dont have to continue to purchase a controller for each vehicle. \nFor batterries, I use Zippy batteries fro hobbyking.  Zippy is an economical but reliable battery.  I would not get into other chinese batteries other than Zippy.  For cars and trucks you want to make sure that you purchase hard case batteries.

{"title": "2013 Honda CBR250R (With ABS)", "price": "3300", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Crown Heights", "description": "\n         \nSup CL, I'm selling my 2013 Honda CBR250r (ABS) motorcycle, with the rare black/black color combo which was only available from Honda on the 2013-2014 models. The motorcycle is in amazing condition, and has been stored in a secure professional parking garage, and has been covered with a Nelson-rigg bike cover whenever it was not being ridden. Only reason I'm selling the bike is because this was my first bike, had it since July 2016 and was ready for something a little more powerful, so I just upgraded to a 2015 Suzuki GSX-R 600, and don't see the sense of having two motorcycles. This is literally the best first motorcycle a person can buy, it is also amazing for commuting, I literally average around 66-71mpg with this bike, and even though my GSX-R 600 is faster, i still ride this bike more, because its comfortable, light as a feather, and fun as hell when you get it in the 6000-8000 rpm range. The bike has never been dropped, tipped over, nor abused. The oil was just changed, aswell as the chain was just inspected, cleaned, and lubed by KING CYCLES late November 2016. The bike does have a Pro-Grip Tank Pad to protect the bike from scratches when your riding in a leaned over position, aswell as a aftermarket 2Bros Carbon Fiber Black Series exhaust slip-on, which was professionally installed by KING CYCLES, and a Perilli Sport Demon rear tire (one of the best motorcycle tires) with plenty of life in them . The bike will also come with the original exhaust, even though I don't recommend putting it back on because it's very quiet, and New York has some of the worst drivers I've ever came across. For new riders, please get a motorcycle with ABS, it will protect you from idiots on the road, and potentially save your life, please don't listen to people saying you don't need ABS, take it from someone who's been riding motorcycles for 7 months now, ABS has saved my ass more than I can count from bad drivers, and bad roads. It's well worth the extra money. The motorcycle has a clean title, and only has 1,140 miles but will go up, since I still ride it whenever we get nice weather. The bike comes with 2 keys, a Nelson-rigg bike cover, a yellow brake disc lock (w/Key), and the original Honda exhaust slip-on. The bike does not need anything but a new owner, you won't even need to buy gas, because it will have a full tank of gas when it's sold. The price is non-negotiable, I'm not desperate for money, or to sell the bike. Thanks for checking my baby out,  Happy New Years to all! Please Note: For your safety, aswell as my bike's safety I will be the one test riding the bike while you follow behind me,    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/01111_g4PitFLPnnn_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00S0S_58SEevGxWU7_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01111_71jNa3jdISl_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_90rSuQH5myA_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_bvrMEA1BzwX_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00o0o_gIKOje0uYsB_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_jTiheczmP6E_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01010_56tIIsMnFeT_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_kzBnBCuG9rU_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00202_be9dbQM2oAo_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_RtITXOUZAd_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00909_1m4R97pecrK_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_4leURbCndoa_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_8d1qs3kL7ED_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_43ijFrB0Uk8_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_ckXoaESI793_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "40.662800", "lng": "-73.954600", "postId": "5955909230", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/mcy/5955909230.html", "postDate": "2017-01-12T08:05:29-0500", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "2013 Honda CBR350r (ABS) excellent 250 gas 1140 black clean manual", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/mcy/5955909230", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:07:18.725674", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

The V110 is among the thinnest and lightest fully rugged convertibles ever built. It is less than 12 x 9 inches in size, a mere 1.3 inches thick and weighs just over 4 pounds. The Getac V110 meets MIL-STD-810G and IP65 standards for durability and protection against dirt, dust, water, motion, vibration, temperature and other factors that would quickly damage a commercial-grade tablet. The V110's large 11.6 inch multi-touch display utilizes the revolutionary LumiBond technology to achieve a display that is more readable, and offers better contrast and more crisp colors. The V110 convertible comes with a full-size, waterproof keyboard. The red backlight allows users to type in low-light conditions without silhouetting themselves. It also reduces eyestrain, which helps reduce fatigue.  \n \n The Getac V110 is powered by Intel Core i5-4300U (1.9GHz) processor, 4GB RAM, and a 128GB solid state drive. The Getac V110 has built-in 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, and optional 4G LTE Mobile broadband to keep workers connected. The optional webcam and 5MP autofocus camera can capture images or video on the go. For vehicle deployments, three pass-through antenna ports can be added, allowing customers to simultaneously connect high-gain GPS, WWAN, and WLAN roof-mounted antennae. The V110's optional dedicated GPS offers 2x search capacity, faster location positioning and improved accuracy over competitors' embedded GPS designs. Dual hot-swappable batteries allow for endless power by simply \"swapping\" in a fresh battery without needing to shut down applications or the operating system. The Getac V110 rugged tablet also has a 3-year bumper-to-bumper warranty!  \n   This ver has dual cameras and dual batteries screen is flawless body in mint condition comes with power supply and windows 10 pro  \n \nThanks for looking  \nMilitary grade tactical laptop. \nFor military, law enforcement, construction workers, land surveyors, private investigators and tactical trainers.  \n \nBelow is the link for the product specs and details \n \nhttp://www.avadirect.com/V110-VWR101-Core-i5-4300U-1-9GHz-Tablet-PC-Barebone-11-6-WXGA-800-Nits-LED-Touch-Screen-4GB-DDR3-128GB-SSD-WC-WiFi-BT-Intel-GMA-HD-Graphic/Product/8381664    \n \n                  $950 negotiable but be nice \nPickup only no shipping cash only no checks no paypal \n \nThanks for looking  \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00h0h_19F3G1pZJHu_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_dFV1GTdi4jn_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_fMDngCWafqJ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_etECfwZkGWx_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_iiqXjGpuUtM_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00303_gWo2ahYmtv5_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "40.791800", "lng": "-73.944700", "postId": "5956535980", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/sys/5956535980.html", "postDate": "2017-01-12T15:06:19-0500", "updateDate": "2017-01-12T15:16:21-0500", "attributes": "excellent", "locAccuracy": "highest", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/sys/5956535980", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:07:19.851998", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

RACK ONLY. Includes lat cables which I carefully twisted for convenience. \n \nYou're looking at a Weider Pro 545 Squat/bench/power rack with a lat pulldown cables attachment on both sides of the unit, as seen on picture. Perfect for a starter home gym or someone who doesn't have time to go to a gym and just wants a small roughly 5x5 feet short unit at their house/apartment. This unit allows for practically any line of workout: bench press (please note that bench is NOT included, you'll have to get your own separately, and for the price, it's obvious), biceps via curling, deadlifting, Squatting, Overhead press for shoulders, close grip bench for triceps, rows for lats, and so much more with the assistance of this one compact unit. Its capacity has proven to hold 700LB via its bar holders and the unit also includes safety pins. Its in good condition, some obvious signs of use can be seen as weights were dropped on it but nothing that would in any way hinder its use or cause malfunction, just a few scratches here and there.  \n \nPlease note that this listing is ONLY for the rack. No bench, bar or weights are included with it. And since I do not drive and the unit is heavy, the buyer will have to come to my area in Brooklyn and pick it up. Please be aware of the fact that you'll need a big enough car as the height of the unit is 7 feet and change. I will help disassemble, and load into the car. No original packaging. No PayPal, no shipping, no checks, no BS please. I won't buy whatever bs you're selling so don't even try. Honest buyers only.

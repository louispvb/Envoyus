The display is protected by strengthened Ion-X glass. And the matching fluoroelastomer band comes in five different colors.Anodized aluminum. Designed to be uncommonly light and strong.For Apple Watch, we created a new alloy of 7000 Series aluminum that's 60 percent stronger than standard alloys. Yet it's very light. Together with the Ion-X glass covering the display, it makes the Sport collection watches up to 30 percent lighter than our stainless steel models. It's also exceptionally pure, with a beautifully consistent appearance that's difficult to achieve with traditional aluminum alloys.Strengthened, lightweight Ion-X glass.To keep the Sport collection models as light as possible, we used an aluminosilicate glass that's especially resistant to scratches and impact. It's fortified at the molecular level through ion exchange, with smaller ions being replaced by larger ones to create a surface layer far tougher than ordinary glass.Bands engineered to keep up with an active lifestyle.Because it's made from a custom high-performance fluoroelastomer, the Sport Band is durable and strong, yet surprisingly soft. The smooth, dense material drapes elegantly across your wrist and feels comfortable next to your skin. An innovative pin-and-tuck closure ensures a clean fit.  \n \n \nSpecs \nProduct Type: Smart Watch  \nBluetooth: Yes Wireless LAN: Yes  \nProduct Family: Watch Sport  \nPlacement: Wrist  \nColor: Silver,White  \nBrand Name: Apple  \nSensor Type: Optical Heart Rate Sensor,Accelerometer,Gyro Sensor,Ambient Light Sensor Application/Usage: Health & Fitness,Communication,Sports  \nMaximum Battery Run Time: 18 Hour  \nWireless LAN Standard: IEEE 802.11b/g/n  \nBluetooth Standard: Bluetooth 4.0  \nWatch Case Height: 1.52\"  \nWatch Case Width: 1.31\"  \nWatch Case Thickness: 0.41\"  \nBody Metrics Measured: Heart Rate  \nHeight: 1.5\"  \nWidth: 1.3\"  \nDepth: 0.4\"  \nDurability: Water Resistant  \n \nWebsite Address: http://www.apple.com  \nMaterial: Anodized Aluminum Case,Stainless Steel Weight (Approximate): 0.88 oz \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_4bBT3qnCoZZ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_irJ4hABSYTM_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_5QuU20abqjo_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_jToON5x7zfb_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "40.781600", "lng": "-73.951100", "postId": "5949731282", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/ele/5949731282.html", "postDate": "2017-01-07T15:44:55-0500", "updateDate": "2017-01-07T15:45:31-0500", "attributes": "new", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/ele/5949731282", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:59:08.719179", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

RACK ONLY. Includes lat cables which I carefully twisted for convenience. \n \nYou're looking at a Weider Pro 545 Squat/bench/power rack with a lat pulldown cables attachment on both sides of the unit, as seen on picture. Perfect for a starter home gym or someone who doesn't have time to go to a gym and just wants a small roughly 5x5 feet short unit at their house/apartment. This unit allows for practically any line of workout: bench press (please note that bench is NOT included, you'll have to get your own separately, and for the price, it's obvious), biceps via curling, deadlifting, Squatting, Overhead press for shoulders, close grip bench for triceps, rows for lats, and so much more with the assistance of this one compact unit. Its capacity has proven to hold 700LB via its bar holders and the unit also includes safety pins. Its in good condition, some obvious signs of use can be seen as weights were dropped on it but nothing that would in any way hinder its use or cause malfunction, just a few scratches here and there.  \n \nPlease note that this listing is ONLY for the rack. No bench, bar or weights are included with it. And since I do not drive and the unit is heavy, the buyer will have to come to my area in Brooklyn and pick it up. Please be aware of the fact that you'll need a big enough car as the height of the unit is 7 feet and change. I will help disassemble, and load into the car. No original packaging. No PayPal, no shipping, no checks, no BS please. I won't buy whatever bs you're selling so don't even try. Honest buyers only.

(AGAIN, any decade, up through today's top series, nicely categorized in menu - pull up by season, then episode!) \n \nWatch LIVE SPORTS - even PPV events - FREE!!!  (NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB, GOLF, UFC, BOXING and even international sports like soccer and cricket!) \n \nWatch ADULT-XXX from top sites - Yes... - all FREE!!!  (YES - with NO monthly fees hitting your credit card!) \n \n*In addition to Free Movies, TV & Live Sporting events... This box turns your ordinary TV into a SUPER SMART TV (think of your TV as a giant tablet!) - check email, Skype loved ones, Watch You-Tube vids, play andriod-based games from the Play Store or stream Pandora! Download any of Androids 1.3 million apps now in the Play Store directly to your TV.... So throw your chromecast, Roku, altered Apple TV, Amazon Fire Stick or similar device away and donate your DVD library to the Goodwill. A \"MUST HAVE\" for any home theater system!  \n \nStream ANY MOVIE, TV SHOW, ADULT-XXX, LIVE SPORTS, LIVE Premium Channels, etc. Many Movies avl. today are still in theaters! (recently, I've watched The Arrival, Rogue 1, Suicide Squad, Sausage Party, Doctor Strange and Hacksaw Ridge, just to name a few!) Or, use the \"search\" function and type in your favorite movie ever and the Stealth will instantly pull it up in seconds - *Think about it... the ability to pull up ANY MOVIE you want to watch - instantly, on-demand is PRICELESS!  You literally will have free and instant access to the LARGEST MOVIE COLLECTION IN THE WORLD!  \n \nPLUG-N-PLAY! *THE ONLY THING REQUIRED IS A HDMI INPUT ON YOUR TV & A GOOD INTERNET CONNECTION (15mbps+) - connect by either Wi-fi -or- Ethernet. *If you're not sure what type of speed you have, contact your internet provider and make sure you are getting at least 15mbps+ download speed (don't worry about the ping or upload speeds). You can also do your own test by visiting speedtest (dot) net  \n \n**Don't be fooled by other cheap Android based Boxes with only 1 GB of RAM or less, or altered boxes (Roku, Apple TV or Firestick)!, our SUPER FAST box has double their speed @ 2 GB of RAM & 8 GB of ROM paired with the fastest CPU in the industry, - those altered boxes mentioned above or cheaper 1 GB Android boxes are KNOWN to overheat, then lock up and eventually burn-out after a few months of straining the CPU..., Don't be fooled into buying an inferior box - with this technology, you get what you pay for! *That is the first, but most important of 3 reasons why the Stealth TV Box is SUPERIOR to all other boxes on the market! **The second of the 3 reasons is the amount of add-ons we offer, which is 100+ Add-ons are like apps on your phone. The Stealth comes pre-loaded with 100+ of the top add-ons, so it will take you months to only scratch the surface of this device! ***Lastly, (third of the 3 reasons) is our ongoing support - DO NOT buy a box that some fly-by-night guy that meets you in a coffee shop has no clue what they are selling you, or even up-to-date on this evolving technology... We have been \"hands-on\" with this technology for over 2 years and will communicate any need to know changes through our YouTube channel at: StealthTVbox/Channel This technology has evolved drastically over the past few years and will continue to evolve and get better with each passing month, so \"support\" is KEY to stay in tuned with the newest and best add-ons, tips, changes, etc. \n \nComes in retail box w/instructions - HDMI cord, remote, and power cord. 1 box is needed per TV... but calculate your monthly cable or satellite bill x 12 months (You're probably giving the cable/satellite giants $2,000+/each year so you will see that getting a 2nd or even 3rd box is still worth the one time price tag. Start with 1, this month - get used to it, then add on another box next month, and so on...  \n \nGet it on ebay (see our feedback!), or with free shipping on our official website - www.stealthtvbox.com    (we have to charge shipping on ebay due to high seller fees we have to pay there) \n \nBest of all... The STEALTH TV BOX is TOTALLY LEGAL! It uses \"open-source\" software to connect to various servers via the world-wide-web, hence you are NOT \"stealing\" a particular satellite or cable company feed! Being NO CONTENT is ever downloaded onto your hard drive, our device is nothing more than a mini computer that only \"streams\" content (never downloads) - thus makes the Stealth legal for us to sell, and you to buy! How is that, you say? On Feb. 26th, 2015 the FCC passed \"net neutrality and open internet rules\" in consumers favor which make \"streaming\" in the comfort of your home legal, as long as you are not \"downloading\" (and redistributing) copyrighted content. Think of it like this - owning a gun is legal, however what you do with it makes all the difference, so play by the FCC rules that state you may \"stream\" content which is already in, what we call the \"internet cloud.\"  \n \n**NOTE: We solely own the Stealth TV Box name, photos and logo(s) so photos are strictly protected and Trade Marked, so please do NOT steal our photos or you will be dealt with accordingly, with legal actions.

Representing the cutting edge of AMD's graphics expertise, GCN GPUs are more than capable of handling workloads-and programming languages-traditionally exclusive to the main processor. Coupled with the dramatic rise of GPU-aware programming languages like C++ AMP and OpenCL\u2122, the GCN Architecture is the right architecture at the right time. \n \n \nAMD Power Tune Smart Performance Tuning \n \nFixed clocks speeds are a thing of the past, Power Tune dynamic performance scaling determines the best clock speed in real time. \n \nAMD PowerTune technology is a significant leap forward to better ensure that performance is optimized for TDP-constrained GPUs. AMD PowerTune technology helps deliver higher performance that is optimized to the thermal limits of the GPU by dynamically adjusting the clock during runtime based on an internally calculated GPU power assessment. \n \n \nTrue Visual Stereoscopic HD3D Ready \n \nThe 3rd dimension is here thanks to AMD \n \nAMD HD3D Technology is supported by an advanced and open ecosystem that, in conjunction with specific AMD hardware and software technologies, enables 3D display capabilities for many PC applications and experiences. \n \n \nMaximized Your Productivity With Dual Display Technology \n \nMultidisplay technology for gaming, productivity and entertainment. \n \nWe are taking you beyond the boundaries of traditional PC displays.

A black curved line on a white background displayed on a computer screen will have some jaggedness along its edges due to the inherent limitations of using discrete pixels to display the image. Anti-aliasing smoothes out this jaggedness by filling in the white spaces between the jagged edges with varying shades of grey which gives you the smooth soft shadows, crisp sharp lines of buildings, and crisp tiny details in clothing that make your experience truely realistic. \n \n \nBullet Physics Engine Technology \n \nGet the most out of your gaming experience with real 3D Physics. \n \nTake advantage of the 3D Physics capabilities of some of today's newest titles which include completely destructable objects, walls and buildings collapsing from gun fire, real particle effects such as fire that react to the environment and realistic details such as moving hair, water and much more. \n \n \nCompatible with the newest Direct X Technology \n \nMeets the standards of the newest games with the latest Direct X driver compatibility. \n \nWith every new generation of Direct X, major improvements are made which greatly advance the graphics capabilities of games.

See the difference for yourself. \n \n \nPartially Resident Textures PRT Technology \n \nRadically change the detail of your games from flat to realistic. \n \nEven in the latest titles, gamers may have noticed that games often reuse or repeat textures, particularly on the ground or in background scenery such as mountains or trees. This is because increasing the physical size or number of textures in a game can have a negative impact on the performance of a GPU. PRT is a radical technology that hopes to break this cycle. \n \nhttps://www.amazon.com/XFX-Core-Radeon-Express-Graphics/dp/B00IEGIIR4 \n \n!!!Also Willing to exchange with iPad Pro 12.9 or 9.7 , Ipad Air , Ipad Mini , iphone 5 , iphone 5s , iphone 6 , iphone 6 plus , iphone 6S, iphone 6S plus , iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus , macbook pro , macbook air , Apple TV , Apple Watch or Bose companion 5 , Samsung , or Sony , or LG , or Panasonic , lcd , led , or plasma TV \nalong with this item I will include lots of other new good items I have so I can match your item for exchange!!!!!!

{"title": "Apple TV 160GB 1st Gen", "price": "40", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Long Island City", "description": "\n         \n \nSteve Jobs said that the Apple TV failed to meet expectations -- although \"techie\" oriented folks such as us were more than pleased with the way it quickly interfaced with iTunes and our home network. But certainly not being able to access the Internet directly other than to watch YouTube was oft-putting, as was the cost for the 40 Gigabyte model (providing roughly 32GB's of space for use) and how it was tied to a computer and iTunes for use. \nBut Jobs doesn't just whine, he delivers, and the results produced the Apple TV Take Two -- a reworking of the idea behind the Apple TV which is about movies -- and which is now all about renting them. Renting does not just come from Disney or some Indie studio, but all of the major ones -- matching easily those other online services which limit theirs to computers only. Apple TV rentals don't leave out being able to be viewed on computers or iPods either (with the exception of high-def; more on this later), so it makes sense that the entire user interface has undergone significant changes to match that of the underlying philosophy now being put into play. And while Apple has also dropped the price of their two models (the other features a 160GB drive), they allowed those of us who bought into the Apple TV about a year ago to update into all of this through a free download. \n\nNow before we do the update, let's consider what the Apple TV is all about. When it first appeared, it was all about integrating with iTunes on your computer so that you could transfer content either wired or wirelessly from it through the Apple TV to your HDTV. By definition this required a Component output on the APPLE TV at the mini-mum for video up to 1080i resolution, with audio transferred through the RCA analog plugs or the optical out (in stereo only), or the HDMI output could be used to transmit both video and audio. The other connectors consisted of an Ethernet plug to connect to the home network (using 10/100 base) and the Internet or you could use the built-in wireless (being the faster 802.11n if you had it, or the slower 802.11b/g). The Apple TV has a price tag of $229 USD for the 40GB version or $329 for the 160GB. \nI had this laying around and its not getting much use.  I've used it to store video and audio content for my network stream.\n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_awf1iw1wyAF_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_eFUTz4m078v_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_jGDR5XswKq_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_54otaR6w7Hd_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "40.744656", "lng": "-73.950348", "postId": "5945135595", "postingUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/sys/5945135595.html", "postDate": "2017-01-04T12:09:15-0500", "updateDate": "2017-01-08T23:48:53-0500", "attributes": "excellent Apple TV/160GB", "locAccuracy": "highest", "sellerUrl": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/reply/nyc/sys/5945135595", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:59:36.302371", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

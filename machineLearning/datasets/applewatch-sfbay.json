With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business.

We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you.

{"title": "Apple iMac 20\" 2006/max RAM/1TB HDD/upgraded CPU", "price": "100", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "lower haight", "description": "\n         \nFor Sale: Apple iMac 20-inch, early 2006 \n \nBasic specs (details below): \n\u2022 20-inch iMac (MA200LL) released in \"early 2006\" by Apple \n\u2022 CPU upgrade from 2GHz Intel Core Duo to 2GHz Core 2 Duo \n\u2022 Maxed out installed memory at 2GB \n\u2022 Replaced 250GB hard drive with 1TB drive \n\u2022 MacOS 10.6.8 installed along with all other recommended Apple updates. \n\u2022 No keyboard; mouse if needed \n\u2022 Apple remote control included \n\u2022 Mini-DVI to DVI adapter included (for second display) \n \nI have a fully-working iMac I'd like to offer. \n \nHere are a few of the sites that describe it: \n\u261e http://support.apple.com/kb/SP35 \n\u261e http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/iMac_Early2006_UG.pdf \n\u261e http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/specs/imac_cd_2.0_20.html \n\u261e http://lowendmac.com/2006/20-in-imac-early-2006/ \n \nThis is a fully working iMac. Shortly before wiping the drive (zeroed seven times, to the DOD 5220-22-M standard) and a new system reinstalled, I was online using wi-fi and transferring data using Dropbox as well as via a flash drive. I even checked out the DVD drive by watching a bit of The Big Short. After wiping everything I installed MacOS 10.6 (installation DVD included) and upgraded to 10.6.8, which is the final recommended OS for this machine (10.7 is possible, apparently, but most sites don't recommend it.  See the Low End Mac link, above). The screenshot attached was taken just before I erased that installation account and reset the \"new-owner experience\" toggle. \n \nThe built-in display has a resolution of 1680x1050. My second display was a standard 1080p monitor at 1920x1080, but it can display 1920x1200, too. The machine has pretty loud built-in speakers. The \"Front Row\" app and remote control make it a pretty nice AV machine. \n \nUntil a year or so ago, this was my workhorse machine. I had it attached to a second full-sized monitor via the Mini-DVI connection (see image), and more than doubling the screen real estate had no effect. But it is a ten-year-old computer, so trying to do work that requires a dozen tabs to be open as well as sophisticated software will slow it down. I was running a copy of Parallels with Windows to run a Windows-only application as well as word-processing, web browsing, etc., on the Mac side, and it just wasn't up to it.  If you only want to browse the 'net and maybe watch Netflix, Youtube and DVDs, this machine is probably completely adequate. \n \nUpgrades: I followed the instructions on iFixit to replace the internal hard drive with a much larger one at one terabyte. The drive is a Seagate Barracuda LP 1TB HDD, which has very high reviews on Google, Newegg and Amazon, so hopefully will last a long time to come. That's one of the major components of the price I'm charging. \n \nI also followed iFixit's instructions on replacing the CPU with a faster one. The new CPU is a 2GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, code number T7200. (The slightly faster 2.16GHz T7400 or 2.33GHz T7600 weren't available at sensible prices at the time, and given that the difficulty rating of the CPU operation is \"very difficult\", probably not worth the gain). According to CPU World, the T7200 is typically about 16% faster than the stock T2500 in single-threaded applications, and even faster in multi-threaded applications. If you don't want to process the jargon: I installed this because it was a substantially faster processor. \n \niFixit guidelines for this model are at: \n\u261e  https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iMac_Intel_20%22_EMC_2105_and_2118 \nCPU comparison at: \n\u261e  http://www.cpu-world.com/Compare/843/Intel_Core_2_Duo_Mobile_T7200_(Socket_M)_vs_Intel_Core_Duo_T2500_(Socket_M).html \n \nI don't have a spare keyboard to go with this; I need it for the iMac I replaced it with. I'd like to keep the mouse it came with (the peculiar Apple Mighty Mouse--not the one shown in the image) as a backup, but if you really need it I can spare it. Keyboards and mice are pretty cheap, whether on Amazon or at Goodwill. Any USB keyboard or mouse will work with any computer with a USB port, after all. \n \nPossible bonus: I have a bunch of unused writeable CDs and DVDs I'd be happy to include; otherwise I'll give them away for free. The built-in optical drive can burn to these, of course. \n \nI also have a box this is packed in, but it from a later iMac. Still, it makes it easier to lug around. \n \nAll of this is located in San Francisco's Lower Haight neighborhood. Drop me a line if you have any questions.

FREE!!! (YES - any decade up through new releases!) \n \nWatch ANY TV SHOW ever made... FREE!!! (AGAIN, any decade, up through today's top series, nicely categorized in menu - pull up by season, then episode!) \n \nWatch LIVE SPORTS - even PPV events - FREE!!! (NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB, GOLF, UFC, BOXING and even international sports like soccer and cricket!) \n \nWatch ADULT-XXX from top sites - Yes... - all FREE!!! (YES - with NO monthly fees hitting your credit card!) \n \n*In addition to Free Movies, TV & Live Sporting events... This box turns your ordinary TV into a SUPER SMART TV (think of your TV as a giant tablet!) - check email, Skype loved ones, Watch You-Tube vids, play andriod-based games from the Play Store or stream Pandora! Download any of Androids 1.3 million apps now in the Play Store directly to your TV.... So throw your chromecast, Roku, altered Apple TV, Amazon Fire Stick or similar device away and donate your DVD library to the Goodwill. A \"MUST HAVE\" for any home theater system!  \n \nStream ANY MOVIE, TV SHOW, ADULT-XXX, LIVE SPORTS, LIVE Premium Channels, etc. Many Movies avl. today are still in theaters! (recently, I've watched The Arrival, Rogue 1, Suicide Squad, Sausage Party, Doctor Strange and Hacksaw Ridge, just to name a few!) Or, use the \"search\" function and type in your favorite movie ever and the Stealth will instantly pull it up in seconds - *Think about it... the ability to pull up ANY MOVIE you want to watch - instantly, on-demand is PRICELESS! You literally will have free and instant access to the LARGEST MOVIE COLLECTION IN THE WORLD!  \n \nPLUG-N-PLAY! *THE ONLY THING REQUIRED IS A HDMI INPUT ON YOUR TV & A GOOD INTERNET CONNECTION (15mbps+) - connect by either Wi-fi -or- Ethernet. *If you're not sure what type of speed you have, contact your internet provider and make sure you are getting at least 15mbps+ download speed (don't worry about the ping or upload speeds). You can also do your own test by visiting speedtest (dot) net  \n \n**Don't be fooled by other cheap Android based Boxes with only 1 GB of RAM or less, or altered boxes (Roku, Apple TV or Firestick)!, our SUPER FAST box has double their speed @ 2 GB of RAM & 8 GB of ROM paired with the fastest CPU in the industry, - those altered boxes mentioned above or cheaper 1 GB Android boxes are KNOWN to overheat, then lock up and eventually burn-out after a few months of straining the CPU..., Don't be fooled into buying an inferior box - with this technology, you get what you pay for! *That is the first, but most important of 3 reasons why the Stealth TV Box is SUPERIOR to all other boxes on the market! **The second of the 3 reasons is the amount of add-ons we offer, which is 100+ Add-ons are like apps on your phone. The Stealth comes pre-loaded with 100+ of the top add-ons, so it will take you months to only scratch the surface of this device! ***Lastly, (third of the 3 reasons) is our ongoing support - DO NOT buy a box that some fly-by-night guy that meets you in a coffee shop has no clue what they are selling you, or even up-to-date on this evolving technology... We have been \"hands-on\" with this technology for over 2 years and will communicate any need to know changes through our YouTube channel at: StealthTVbox/Channel This technology has evolved drastically over the past few years and will continue to evolve and get better with each passing month, so \"support\" is KEY to stay in tuned with the newest and best add-ons, tips, changes, etc. \n \nComes in retail box w/instructions - HDMI cord, remote, and power cord. 1 box is needed per TV... but calculate your monthly cable or satellite bill x 12 months (You're probably giving the cable/satellite giants $2,000+/each year so you will see that getting a 2nd or even 3rd box is still worth the one time price tag. Start with 1, this month - get used to it, then add on another box next month, and so on...  \n \nGet it on ebay (see our feedback!), or with free shipping on our official website - www.stealthtvbox.com (we have to charge shipping on ebay due to high seller fees we have to pay there) \n \nBest of all... The STEALTH TV BOX is TOTALLY LEGAL! It uses \"open-source\" software to connect to various servers via the world-wide-web, hence you are NOT \"stealing\" a particular satellite or cable company feed! Being NO CONTENT is ever downloaded onto your hard drive, our device is nothing more than a mini computer that only \"streams\" content (never downloads) - thus makes the Stealth legal for us to sell, and you to buy! How is that, you say? On Feb. 26th, 2015 the FCC passed \"net neutrality and open internet rules\" in consumers favor which make \"streaming\" in the comfort of your home legal, as long as you are not \"downloading\" (and redistributing) copyrighted content. Think of it like this - owning a gun is legal, however what you do with it makes all the difference, so play by the FCC rules that state you may \"stream\" content which is already in, what we call the \"internet cloud.\"  \n \n**NOTE: We solely own the Stealth TV Box name, photos and logo(s) so photos are strictly protected and Trade Marked, so please do NOT steal our photos or you will be dealt with accordingly, with legal actions.

{"title": "Mackie DL1608 Digital Mixer with Wi-Fi Router", "price": "599", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "millbrae", "description": "\n         \nDigital mixer of the year, the ultra-compact 16-channel 8-bus Mackie DL-1608. Wireless remote control from iPad and iPhone from anywhere in the venue, ton of features that doesn't exist in other analog and digital mixers, and all this fits in a standard laptop bag! \n \n- Excellent ONYX mic preamps, the same as in ONYX-80 series large format analog mixers and ONYX recording interfaces. Accept ANY signal source, from condenser mics to line-level (keyboards, digital drums, iPhone/iPod, CD player, etc.) \n- Full digital control, including scenes memory and recall.  \n- 4-band fully parametric EQ and full dynamics suite (compressor, limiter, gate, expander) on each and every input and output. \n- Eight 31-band graphic equalizers with +/- 15dB range (more than typical 12dB), also with unique \"Draw\" feature (let you draw a desired EQ curve right on iPad, instead of moving each slider separately). \n- Two independent effects processors with all the stuff you may need for a gig: reverbs, delays, etc. \n- Channels and effects preset libraries. Real time saver, you can load typical preset like \"Kick drum\", \"Piano\", \"Guitar\", Female VOX\", etc, it gets 90% of job done, then you can tweak it to your taste. \n- Instant one-button two-track or multi-track recording straight to iPad. You can record your event as multitrack session and later polish it in a studio with any DAW (ProTools, Logic, Cubase, etc.) \n- Remote levels control from any iPhone or iPod Touch. You can let musicians dial their own monitor mixes (up to 6 independent mono mixes). This feature is a lifesaver, no more \"I can't hear myself in monitors\" or \"I need more of this and that\"). In fact you are getting a full functionality of an Aviom personal monitor mixers for free: everyone has an iPhone today, all you need is to download a free app! \n \nDL1608 can easily handle a typical 4-5 piece band gig (most bands fit into 16-channel grid, even with fully miked drum kit, and never need more than 6 separate monitor mixes). I've done plenty of cover bands with this mixer. \n \nToo many features to list here, read online reviews or download MasterFader app to your iPad and try it in demo mode, it's awesome! New version 4.0 adds bunch of new features: custom channel layers, VCAs, 6-band parametric EQ on outputs, etc. etc.  \n \nAlso watch MasterFader launch video: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yCGH5mmGaU \n \nThe most comprehensive video tutorial on DL1608 covering the latest MasterFader \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0OnElTV5oo \nIt's an hour long, but covers EVERYTHING, definitely worth watching at least once. \n \nThis is 30-pin dock version (for iPad 1 and 2). Can be used with any iPad model, from Mini to Pro (for newer iPads with Lighting connector you can use a 30-pin-to-Lighting adapter ($29 from Apple Store or around $6 on eBay), or just use Wi-Fi connection. (Note that all other iPad-controlled mixers on the market doesn't even have a dock for iPad, Wi-Fi only!). Mixer hardware is identical in both, so they sounds the same. All the sound processing is done inside of DL-1608, iPad is just the controller (also, if you'll lose Wi-Fi connection to the mixer, nothing will happen, it will still pass audio in the state it was left on). \n \nMixer is in excellent condition, everything works 100%. Selling only the mixer with power supply, iPad is shown just for illustration, how it looks together. Works with all iPad models. Comes with Linksys wireless router, all set up and ready to go. Make sure to download MasterFader app to your iPad before coming if you want to test it (it's also a good way to learn mixer in offline mode). I can test functionality with my iPad if desired. It doesn't take a lot of iPad computing power to work, so the older iPads work fine, and those are dirt cheap today ($100-130 for iPad 2, there's about 400 of them for sale on Craigslist at the moment). \n \nSince you see this ad now, it means the mixer is STILL AVAILABLE    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_1dqWhybXNK_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_8bxMoaAiTfU_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00707_1zWijiED5gb_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00808_5sBk9z0mtSK_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_h4qE1Lg8k9d_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_dnE40El0q8_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_6k7lrCH4XCl_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_bK8NFLb1UoX_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_23T9LbuLGio_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_b58DYLCBhNZ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_lWAml0iZZW3_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.539500", "lng": "-122.299800", "postId": "5913292572", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/msg/5913292572.html", "postDate": "2016-12-10T02:31:01-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-07T00:43:16-0800", "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "highest", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/msg/5913292572", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:48:54.375756", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "Bang & Olufsen BeoSystem 2500 - $595 or reasonable best offer", "price": "595", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "mill valley", "description": "\n         \nSelling 1991 Bang & Olufsen BeoSystem 2500 stereo with BeoLab 2500 Active Loudspeakers all in excellent condition.   \n \nHere is a Video that I shot of the unit loading and playing a CD.  Watch to the end. \nhttps://vimeo.com/174031642 \n \nThis unit is complete with a B&O Beolink 1000 Remote Control.  The CD Player and FM work perfectly, including the auto open Glass Doors and Interior Lights.  The Tape Player does not work, but who plays tapes. For $30 you can purchase a high quality adapter to connect the B&O 2500 to your phone directly or to an Apple Airport Express to Stream Music wirelessly.  http://www.ebay.com/itm/6ft-3-5mm-Stereo-Step-Down-Plug-to-DIN-7-Bang-Olufsen-Audio-Cable-BO-806Z-/391316071127 \n \nThis unit was completely serviced in 2007 by Bang & Olufsen, including New Door Belt, Cleaned and Lubricated.  New CD Clamper and Capstan Belt. \n \nWave your hand in front of the 2500 and the two glass doors slide horizontally apart and a diffuse interior light brightens. The open doors expose the CD player at the top, the control panel with its 40 small identical rectangular buttons in the center.  A small amber display above the buttons indicates source, radio station and other settings. Several seconds after you load your CD, or make your radio-station choice, the glass doors silently slide closed and the light dims.  \n \nThe sliding glass doors aren`t the only parts of the BeoSystem 2500 that work like magic. Press the ``load`` button and the CD clamping mechanism gracefully rises, allowing you to place a CD on the spindle. Press CD or one of the numbered keys to lower the clamp and start the disc spinning. Very few players use the spinning disc as a design element as the 2500 does. The CD player contains the same programming features as most other CD players, such as being able to program 20 tracks in any order. The circuitry uses dual 16-bit digital-to-analog converters. While this bucks the industry trend toward single-bit converters, the D/A chips that B&O has chosen are of high quality and sound excellent. \n \nBeoSystem 2500 Product Specifications: \n \nDimensions W x H x D: 83 x 36 x 16 cm  \nWeight: 20 kg  \nBlack front  \n98 dB IEC stereo  \nActive speakers frequency range + 4 - 8 dB 55 - 20,000 Hz  \nPre-tuned radio programmes 2 x 20 FM or AM  \nTuner range FM 87.5 - 108 MHz  \n76 - 90 MHz (Japan)  \nLW 150 - 350 kHz  \nMW 520 - 1610 kHz  \nPower consumption/minimum Max. 35 watts/ 4 watts (Beocenter only)  \n \nCD player built-in  \nFrequency range: 3 - 20,000 Hz +/- 3 dB  \nSignal-to-noise ratio A-weighted > 110 dB  \nConverter system: 2 x 16 bit 4 x oversampling  \n \nConnections:  \nBeocord Tape 2 Via Aux socket  \nBeogram LP (RIAA built-in) Via Aux socket  \nBeoLab speakers 2 x Power Link  \nBeovision Via AUX socket  \nLocal rooms, speakers 2 Via MCL 2P  \nAux 7-pin socket \n \n \nBeoLab 2500 Active Loudspeakers Product Specifications: \n \nMaximum Sound Pressure Level (stereo, pair) 98 dB  \nPower amplifier modules 2 units, Class AB  \nLong-term maximum output power per module* 65 watts  \nEffective Frequency range* 55 - 20,000 Hz  \nCabinet principle Bass Reflex  \nMagnetic shielded No  \nWoofer 11cm  \nTweeter 2.5 cm  \nNet volume 2.8 litre  \n(* According to IEC 268-3 and 268-5) Dimensions W x H x D/Weight 26 x 36 x 13cm (12cm with front cloth 6036) / 6kg  \nCabinet finish: black  \nPower consumption Typical 10 W/stand-by < 2 W  \nConnections: Power Link: 2    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_47EFg7oBoXg_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01515_9WMkMB71McU_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00303_dJJMdLdAfqK_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01717_dSpfgzgKkc5_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_blyraKfRmT9_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_gQVYbDZLtZ9_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.895800", "lng": "-122.533900", "postId": "5951386718", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/nby/ele/5951386718.html", "postDate": "2017-01-08T20:09:07-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "excellent Bang & Olufsen Beosystem 2500", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/ele/5951386718", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:48:55.647189", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

Five two three, five zero three one. No Texting. \n \nSelling Sharpening Stones, made by DMT. Diamond Sharpening type. Each stone has 2 different grades of coarseness. Buy 2 stones and you have coarse to fine to extra fine covered. Start with the Coarse Blue & Fine Red color, then use the Fine Red & Extra Fine Green to get your knife paper cutting sharp. If your knife is dull, you should start with the Coarse Blue color first, then proceed through the other 2 grades. All it takes is 10 - 20 passes per side and it will be sharp again. No oil or water required. Water is recommended but you can also use them dry. These open like a multi tool and fold into a plastic covering. Very easy to use and only requires a few minutes. If you can cut an apple, you can sharpen your knives. Hold the knife at at a 22 degree angle, half of a 45 degree angle, and slice the stone like you would cut an apple. Since I bought them in pairs, I would like to sell them as a 2 piece set. Buy 2 pieces for $70 and you get 3 levels of coarseness and 4 different sides which will cover all your sharpening needs or I can sell you a single Coarse/Fine Stone for $35 since I have 2 of these in single pieces. These sell online for $45 each. You save $10 per stone and 20% off online prices. I will provide free instruction on how to use it. Watch this short video and you'll see how easy it is to sharpen your own knives: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeOW_JUqqpw \n \nThese sharpening stones can be used to sharpen: Scissors, Poultry Shears, Paring Knife, Utility Knife, Router Bit, Sport Knife, Floral Knife, Pruner, Lopper, Hatchet, Ax, Spade, Shovel \n \nCOARSE Blue - Quickly restores a dull edge to cutting sharp again. Customers that desire cutting fast action without worry of edge refinement often use our coarse models. Color code: coarse (45 micron, 325 mesh) \"blue\". \n \nFINE Red - Restores to a fine edge any knife or tool that is slightly dull. Many of our customers consider the fine grit to be a medium/all purpose sharpener. Professional Chefs and gourmet cooks prefer using our fine grit models. For woodworkers and sportsman who are stepping through the grits, it is the edge refinement step done before micro beveling and polishing. Color code: fine (25 micron, 600 mesh) \"red\". \n \nEXTRA FINE Green - Refines and polishes the sharp edge to razor sharp perfection.

{"title": "Like New Panasonic 55\" Plasma TV (This One's A Keeper!)", "price": "750", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "santa clara", "description": "\n         \nYou are going to love this 55\" TV the moment you set eyes on it. Why is this special? \n \n1) Most of the other plasma's you will see on CL are smaller than 55\" \n2) Most of the other plasmas on CL that *are* this size are not Panasonics. Look it up, Panasonic Plasma's have THE BEST picture, better than Samsung, too. But if you're looking at this, you already know that. \n3) Why an older model TV? Because plasmas stopped being produced in ~2013 and to this date no LED LCD TV has come close to matching the picture - the only exception being the brand new OLEDs, which come really close. Go ahead and buy one if you have have $2500-3500 burning a hole in your pockets. \n4) Even the best new LCDs struggle to match the blacks that this TV can produce. Look it up! LCDs produce washed out blacks that are not truly black. If that doesn't bother you, go buy that new TV from Costco. I ain't mad. \n5) This TV has NEVER, EVER been turned onto its side. If you're looking at this plasma, then you know your TV being turned on its side can damage the picture. I bet few or even none of those other CL listings even mentioned that. Extra special care was always taken with this baby. NO scratches or dents. We take care of our stuff! \n \nYou're looking at this listing because you know plasma produces the best picture. This TV has more HDMI ports than most of those new LCDs you see being sold in Costco or Walmart as well. Hook up your Apple TV/Amazon Fire TV, PS4, X-Box One, and Wii U all at the same time and see them in all their full HD 1080p glory. It also comes with the original remote, which is way less cluttered than Samsung's remotes. \n \nWorried about your TV monitoring you and invading your privacy with that silly Smart TV crap? Guess what? This TV has no microphone to record your voice and no camera to snoop in on you while you watch. This is the TV you want. Your search has ended. \n \nWhy am I selling it if I love it so much? I just bought a 2013 65\" Panasonic Plasma, the last of its kind and the top of the line model they offered. That's right, I didn't waste $3k on an OLED. It's time for me to sell this to a person/family that will enjoy it as much as I have. \n \nSeriously interested? I'll throw in a free wall mount made specifically for this TV. It also comes with its original TV stand. \n \nPrice is firm, but you're getting one hell of a deal. Need specs? Hit me up, but chances are you already know how dope this TV is.

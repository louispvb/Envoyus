FREE!!! (YES - any decade up through new releases!) \n \nWatch ANY TV SHOW ever made... FREE!!! (AGAIN, any decade, up through today's top series, nicely categorized in menu - pull up by season, then episode!) \n \nWatch LIVE SPORTS - even PPV events - FREE!!! (NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB, GOLF, UFC, BOXING and even international sports like soccer and cricket!) \n \nWatch ADULT-XXX from top sites - Yes... - all FREE!!! (YES - with NO monthly fees hitting your credit card!) \n \n*In addition to Free Movies, TV & Live Sporting events... This box turns your ordinary TV into a SUPER SMART TV (think of your TV as a giant tablet!) - check email, Skype loved ones, Watch You-Tube vids, play andriod-based games from the Play Store or stream Pandora! Download any of Androids 1.3 million apps now in the Play Store directly to your TV.... So throw your chromecast, Roku, altered Apple TV, Amazon Fire Stick or similar device away and donate your DVD library to the Goodwill. A \"MUST HAVE\" for any home theater system!  \n \nStream ANY MOVIE, TV SHOW, ADULT-XXX, LIVE SPORTS, LIVE Premium Channels, etc. Many Movies avl. today are still in theaters! (recently, I've watched The Arrival, Rogue 1, Suicide Squad, Sausage Party, Doctor Strange and Hacksaw Ridge, just to name a few!) Or, use the \"search\" function and type in your favorite movie ever and the Stealth will instantly pull it up in seconds - *Think about it... the ability to pull up ANY MOVIE you want to watch - instantly, on-demand is PRICELESS! You literally will have free and instant access to the LARGEST MOVIE COLLECTION IN THE WORLD!  \n \nPLUG-N-PLAY! *THE ONLY THING REQUIRED IS A HDMI INPUT ON YOUR TV & A GOOD INTERNET CONNECTION (15mbps+) - connect by either Wi-fi -or- Ethernet. *If you're not sure what type of speed you have, contact your internet provider and make sure you are getting at least 15mbps+ download speed (don't worry about the ping or upload speeds). You can also do your own test by visiting speedtest (dot) net  \n \n**Don't be fooled by other cheap Android based Boxes with only 1 GB of RAM or less, or altered boxes (Roku, Apple TV or Firestick)!, our SUPER FAST box has double their speed @ 2 GB of RAM & 8 GB of ROM paired with the fastest CPU in the industry, - those altered boxes mentioned above or cheaper 1 GB Android boxes are KNOWN to overheat, then lock up and eventually burn-out after a few months of straining the CPU..., Don't be fooled into buying an inferior box - with this technology, you get what you pay for! *That is the first, but most important of 3 reasons why the Stealth TV Box is SUPERIOR to all other boxes on the market! **The second of the 3 reasons is the amount of add-ons we offer, which is 100+ Add-ons are like apps on your phone. The Stealth comes pre-loaded with 100+ of the top add-ons, so it will take you months to only scratch the surface of this device! ***Lastly, (third of the 3 reasons) is our ongoing support - DO NOT buy a box that some fly-by-night guy that meets you in a coffee shop has no clue what they are selling you, or even up-to-date on this evolving technology... We have been \"hands-on\" with this technology for over 2 years and will communicate any need to know changes through our YouTube channel at: StealthTVbox/Channel This technology has evolved drastically over the past few years and will continue to evolve and get better with each passing month, so \"support\" is KEY to stay in tuned with the newest and best add-ons, tips, changes, etc. \n \nComes in retail box w/instructions - HDMI cord, remote, and power cord. 1 box is needed per TV... but calculate your monthly cable or satellite bill x 12 months (You're probably giving the cable/satellite giants $2,000+/each year so you will see that getting a 2nd or even 3rd box is still worth the one time price tag. Start with 1, this month - get used to it, then add on another box next month, and so on...  \n \nGet it on ebay (see our feedback!), or with free shipping on our official website - www.stealthtvbox.com (we have to charge shipping on ebay due to high seller fees we have to pay there) \n \nBest of all... The STEALTH TV BOX is TOTALLY LEGAL! It uses \"open-source\" software to connect to various servers via the world-wide-web, hence you are NOT \"stealing\" a particular satellite or cable company feed! Being NO CONTENT is ever downloaded onto your hard drive, our device is nothing more than a mini computer that only \"streams\" content (never downloads) - thus makes the Stealth legal for us to sell, and you to buy! How is that, you say? On Feb. 26th, 2015 the FCC passed \"net neutrality and open internet rules\" in consumers favor which make \"streaming\" in the comfort of your home legal, as long as you are not \"downloading\" (and redistributing) copyrighted content. Think of it like this - owning a gun is legal, however what you do with it makes all the difference, so play by the FCC rules that state you may \"stream\" content which is already in, what we call the \"internet cloud.\"  \n \n**NOTE: We solely own the Stealth TV Box name, photos and logo(s) so photos are strictly protected and Trade Marked, so please do NOT steal our photos or you will be dealt with accordingly, with legal actions.

The iPad has been updated to the most current OS version 10, and has had all data reset, so it is ready for a new owner.  It can be used with Wi-Fi or AT and T.  The iPad is 9.5\" x 7.31\" x 0.34\" and weighs 1.35 pounds. \n \nThe iPad Smart cover protects the screen without covering the back.  An aluminum hinge magnetically aligns the cover with the iPad and can be set up to wake on open and to sleep on close.  It can be folded back to tilt the iPad to type using the iPads internal keypad.  It can also be folded to make a movie or use as a Facetime stand. \n \nThe Logitech keyboard/cover and stand is ultra-thin, Bluetooth wireless, and includes USB to micro USB charging cable.  It is very well designed, weighs less than 12 ounces and attaches using the same hinging mechanism as Apple's Smart Cover (magnetically).  When attached and closed it protects the screen and puts the iPad to sleep.  When removed, an angled slot behind the keyboard holds the iPad at a comfortable angle for typing. \n \nThe Logitech UE Mobile Boombox/Speaker is a wireless Bluetooth speaker for the iPad, tablet, or phone and that doubles as a speakerphone for hands-free calls; it is ultra portable with 10-hour rechargeable battery. \n \nThe Motorokr S305 Bluetooth wireless Headset allows you to manage your music using On-ear-music-controls to play, pause, next, previous, and volume - all from the headset.  It is rechargeable, and includes all documentation.   \n \nThe 30-pin digital AV adapter (there is an extra one) plugs into the iPad; the other end has two plugs: one for a HDMI cable (not included) which plugs into a screen or TV, and the other to plug into a USB cable to charge your iPad.  This can be used to watch HDMI movies on a larger screen without running out of power. \n \nThe Apple iPad 10W USB Power Adapters (there is an extra one) are designed to plug into an electrical power outlet and into the iPad to charge it, or to plug into a USB port on your computer to sync it with iTunes or charge it.  Its USB plug plugs into its electrical plug.   \n \nThe Steampunk embroidered fabric carry case and Steampunk Gelaskin cover and wallpaper are included if desired; the Gelaskin covers the front and back of the iPad, is thin and tough scratch resistant and easily removed if not desired.  The fabric embroidered carry case is rigid yet soft enough to provide excellent protection for the iPad. \n \nThe stylus can be used in place of fingers if desired. \n \nIf you desire to purchase this iPad and its accessories, please send me your first name and a telephone number where I can speak to you; otherwise I will assume you are a spammer.  I will remove the ad promptly when sold. \n \nSearch: iPad, tablet, wi-fi, electronics, Apple \n \n \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_i78HOk4Aq16_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_jSH43ntfdbG_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_cPG1Vfckxlm_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01717_al95HVZOZQU_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00B0B_dN9w0GpfQL1_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_cg7sJJNG4hD_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01414_aagyIxb65wf_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_gk58mNhOTmO_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_7mlUPh5uxiG_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00404_ejZUsh92CzC_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_7oe8M62krIS_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00505_lBTrZZowswU_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "33.567741", "lng": "-112.065405", "postId": "5917483115", "postingUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/nph/ele/5917483115.html", "postDate": "2016-12-13T08:01:32-0700", "updateDate": "2016-12-22T11:13:31-0700", "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/ele/5917483115", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:42:21.132253", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

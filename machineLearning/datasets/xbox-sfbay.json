This is the launch-edition white color console initially released in August 2016. It is absolutely brand new, never opened, and ready to go. I have the original purchase receipt and the console is eligible for warranty registration through Microsoft. It also comes with a bonus white wireless controller so two controllers total.  \n \nOther features for this Xbox includes: \n-\tLarge 2TB storage space so you don't have to worry about using an external drive and tangling with more cables to connect your saved games. \n-\t4K support UHD resolution for 4K gaming, Blu-Ray playback, and 4K video streaming on Netflix (available now). If you have a 4K TV or looking to purchase in the near future, the XBox will support the TV's native resolution. \n-\t40% smaller and lighter compared older XBox One versions. It only comes with an AC power cord and the power brick is consolidated within the XBox unit, thus taking up less space. \n \nThe entire bundle is MSRP $450 before sales tax, bringing it to almost $500 after taxes.  \n \nThe price you see here in the headline is what you get.

Thanks \n \n \n \nSet in the science fiction realms of the film franchise crossover, Aliens vs. Predator is a high-definition action-adventure composed of tense, violent, kill-or-be-killed scenarios. Following the design concept of earlier AvP shooters, the game pits three different factions against one another. Players take the roles of deadly xenomorph aliens, stealthy predators, and heavily armed space marines, to do battle with enemies from the other two factions. Evolved to protect the brood, the alien xenomorphs are unmatched in melee combat, and excel at surprise attacks with their overpowering strength. Born of a species of hunters, the predator is a master of well-timed assaults and agile attacks. Physically weak but at a technological advantage, the human marines use heavy firepower to take down enemies from a distance. In many of the game's levels, warriors from all three factions must fight against one another in the same battles, at the same time. \n \nGreat video game.

The action centers on Oryx, who leads the new Taken race on a quest to destroy the Guardians and avenge the death of his son Crota. Players must make their way onto Oryx's massive Hive Dreadnaught ship, use new abilities, weapons, and gear to defeat his corrupted army, and eventually bring down the Taken King. This Legendary Edition includes the full original game, The Taken King expansion, and all other previously released DLC. \n \nThe action once again finds gamers serving as a Guardian, exploring long-lost civilizations on Earth and its closest neighbors. Players can create and customize their Guardian, choosing from the cyborg Exo, ethereal Awoken, and Human species, and then selecting from the Hunter, Warlock, and Titan classes. The Taken King introduces three new subclasses, with Warlocks harnessing electricity, Hunters using a bow made of gravitational void energy, and Titans wielding a flaming hammer. This expansion increases the level cap to 40, includes new Crucible PvP maps, new co-op Strike missions, and a new six-player Raid, and the friendly robot companion Ghost returns, though with the voice of Nolan North instead of Peter Dinklage. \n \n \n \nProduct Highlights \nVideo\t \n \nProduct Identifiers \nPublisher\tActivision \nGame\tDestiny: The Taken King - Legendary Edition \nUPC\t047875874503 \n \nKey Features \nPlatform\tMicrosoft Xbox One \nESRB Rating\tT - Teen \nGenre\tShooter \nGame Edition\tLegendary Edition \nLocation\tUSA \n \nTech Details \nESRB Descriptor\tAnimated Blood, Violence \nControl Elements\tGamepad/Joystick \nNumber of Players\t1-12 \nRelease Year\t2015 \nGame Special Features\t \nExplore Earth, the Moon, Venus, and Mars while battling hostile aliens 700 years in the future \n \nCreate and customize characters, and collect resources to upgrade weapons and gear \n \nJoin friends for a variety of competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes \n \nTravel to a new PvE area set on a giant spaceship and defeat hordes of new foes \n \nRaises the level cap to 40 and includes all previously released DLC \n \nPrice is firm  \nItem is used    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5956756623", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/ele/5956756623.html", "postDate": "2017-01-12T14:32:30-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-12T14:40:06-0800", "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "medium", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/ele/5956756623", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:48:07.971026", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

The action takes place in and around Boston roughly 200 years after a nuclear holocaust, with gamers assuming the role of the last survivor of a large fallout shelter known as Vault 111. Upon emerging from their shelter, players confront a devastated landscape where various factions battle for control of small settlements, and the wilderness teems with dangerous creatures, violent robots, mutated monsters, and deadly radiation. \n \nGamers begin by creating their character, choosing from either a male or female vault survivor, and then customizing seven different S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skills. They are then free to roam the entire landscape as they please, meeting a variety of interesting characters, completing tasks, collecting bottle caps as currency, and acquiring useful items and weapons. Players can choose to interact with the world from a first- or third-person perspective, and combat once again mixes real-time action with turn-based elements in the form of the V.A.T.S. system, which lets gamers use action points to slow time and target specific areas of a foe's body. Fallout 4 introduces the ability to automatically perform critical hits, followed by a cooldown period, and for the first time in a Bethesda game, the player character can speak.

He moves swiftly and stealthily about through the shadows of Tamriel, playing with the minds of the peasants. Sometimes he calms those who panic when they wake up and find him stealing their Void Salts in the dead of night. Other times he sends unsuspecting tribes of Forsworn into a curious frenzy of self-mutilation. Sometimes when facing undead, Loki himself goes up in flames. He remains unharmed while all those who venture within the boundaries of his fire do not. They all turn to ash. All the while, Loki keeps to the shadows and quietly directs the fate of Tamriel, pulling the strings of the townsfolk, all of whom are his puppets. \n... \nIn sum, Loki is a badass and he still has a lot of room to develop if you enjoy playing as him. He's only like, level 22, but his Sneak and Illusion stats are around 70. \n \nBut you can buy this XBox and trash Loki, too, obviously. That's also an option.

The X12 features massive 50mm speakers, delivering superior audio quality with crisp highs and deep, rumbling lows.

It also features an improved, acoustically-tuned, earcup design for greater comfort and better sound quality. Playing your favorite game with the X12 gives you a significant advantage because you can hear sound cues that are missed with speakers, such as the soft footsteps of an enemy sneaking up on you, or the click of a loading weapon in the distance. That means you'll react faster and take them out before they take you out, giving you a competitive edge that can make the difference between winning and losing. If you're serious about gaming, then get serious about the sound.

The story is set in the year 2065, when air defense systems have grown so advanced that most combat involves robotic humanoids battling behind enemy lines. Gamers take control of a group of supersoldiers as they make their way through expansive levels designed to accommodate four players. Each character can be fully customized, and gamers can collect tokens to acquire new weapons and unlock new gear. \n \nThe competitive multiplayer modes now feature a new momentum-based movement system designed to create more fluid action, with gamers using thrust jumps, wall runs, and slides, while still maintaining the ability to fire their weapons. A new Specialist character system lets players pick from a handful of unique soldiers, master their weapons and abilities, and rank them up, while the new Gunsmith feature offers hundreds of ways to customize weapons. Black Ops III also marks the return of Treyarch's signature zombie gameplay, with the new Shadows of Evil mode offering a film-noir experience set in the 1940s fictional town of Morg City. Gamers choose from four troubled and amnesia-stricken protagonists, and then guide them through multiple districts, earning XP along the way. \n \nProduct Highlights \nVideo\t \n \nProduct Identifiers \nPublisher\tActivision \nGame\tCall of Duty: Black Ops III \nMPN\t047875874664 \nUPC\t047875874664 \n \nKey Features \nPlatform\tMicrosoft Xbox One \nESRB Rating\tM - Mature \nGenre\tShooter \nLocation\tUSA \n \nTech Details \nESRB Descriptor\tBlood and Gore, Drug Reference, Intense Violence, Strong Language \nControl Elements\tGamepad/Joystick \nNumber of Players\t1-4 \nRelease Year\t2015 \nGame Special Features\t \nGuide a special team of robotic humanoids as they battle behind enemy lines \n \nJoin friends for the four-player co-op campaign or a variety of competitive multiplayer modes \n \nBattle hordes of undead in the new Shadows of Evil zombie mode \n \nGame Series\tCall of Duty: Black Ops Series \n \nPrice is Firm  \nItem is Used \n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5956765390", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/ele/5956765390.html", "postDate": "2017-01-12T14:38:58-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "medium", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/ele/5956765390", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:49:00.296550", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "RARE PS2 Gamester FPS Master programmable controller by Radica \"Scuf\"", "price": "30", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "rohnert pk / cotati", "description": "\n         \nThis is a rare and interesting 3rd party controller for the Playstation 2 that has a cult following. This is designed around first person shooters, optimizing button layout to keep your thumbs on the analog sticks as much as possible. The controller will work with any PS2 game, but you wouldn't want to use them for racing games. \n \nThe grips are styled after pistols, and the triggers are more abrupt than the long throw, heavy sprung triggers on the Xbox 360 for example. That means less fatigue in shooter games where you pull a trigger rapidly. The Radica Gamester FPS Master has 2 long, curved grips that feature rubber texturing front and back. The trigger is surrounded by a guard, just like a real gun. \n \nOn top, the dual analog sticks are placed in a natural, neutral position. The grip design places your thumbs in line with the sticks. You don't have to reach for them. The left side features the D-pad and the start and select buttons, while the circle and square buttons are located below the right stick. \n \nOn the inside edge of the grips there are 2 buttons on each side that fall under your middle and ring fingers. These are L1 and R1 along with 'X' and Triangle. This was a revolutionary design for the time. It does a lot of the things high end and modified controllers like Scuf and the Xbox One Elite controller offer these days. \n \nIn the middle of the controller is a small backlit LCD screen and 6 buttons that let you remap the buttons and save 3 different configurations. If you don't like the default button assignments, you can change them, you'll just have to remember what each button is vs what symbol is marked on the body of the controller. This is built into the controller itself and is totally  independent of the Playstation 2. \n \nI am downsizing my collection of video games and controllers. This is a great piece of VG history, and actually very comfortable to hold in my opinion. This would make a great gift as a collectible or to open and use. The build quality is not Sony / Microsoft or Nintendo level however.

{"title": "The  Torch wifi \"nanny\"", "price": "90", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "willow glen / cambrian", "description": "\n         \nNot sure how to describe this so I call it a \"wifi interrupter\". It's similar to the Circle by Disney and is a device you attach to your modem that enables you, very easily from an app on your phone, to control the wifi going to each and every device you set up.  You can block specific sites, genres of sites (i.e. gambling, online games) or flat out shut off wifi to a particular device without shutting down your ipad in the process. \n \nKid on Xbox Live too much? Shut it down or set specific time limits for Xbox without having to pull the wifi plug on every other device in the house (who hasn't changed the wifi password or unplugged wifi out of frustration then had to go back and log in each. and. every. device. again.?) \n \nWant to block homework kids from games and social media during homework time but not shut the toddler off from the ipad? With Torch you can set up profiles for, and control, each device individually. Or, want to shut everyone off during dinner? You can do that with one tap, all at once. \n \nMy own two cents is this it worth it for the arguments it stops; the whining that goes along with \"turn off Minecraft, NOW\". It just shuts them down when the specified time comes.  Furthermore, you'll never giggle more than when you say to your kids \"if you hit your brother one more time and I'm turning off your wifi\", and then...you touch a button on the app and BOOM, no more wifi!  \n \nSo...if it's so great, why am I getting rid of it? Well..... \n \nI bought this during a Kickstarter campaign almost 2 years ago but it took longer to ship than expected so I broke down and bought the Circle instead. Now I don't need the Torch, though I think it's probably more robust than Circle. I just don't have the patience to get used to a new platform, even though setup for both is easy-peasy. \n \nVisit mytorch.com to learn more about the setup and check the pics to see what it looks like and some of the features.

That's because the DACmini PX adds a power amplifier to CEntrance's popular and award-winning DACmini CX. The DACmini PX consists of, in fact, three highly capable audio products in one. It's a DAC, a headphone amp, and a power amp all packaged in a compact, machined aluminum chassis that looks great on a desk or shelf. A Versatile Audio Hub The DACmini PX is designed to be the centerpiece of your computer audio system. It returns the warmth to your digital audio without being obtrusive. As a mini system with elevated sound quality, DACmini PX offers hours of fatigue-free listening enjoyment. Satisfied owners praise the sound for having \"transparent highs, tight bass, and clarity in the mid-range only found in products well above the $1,000 price range.\" The DACmini PX features 24-bit, 192 kHz performance over SPDIF and 24-bit, 96 kHz over USB. It produces virtually unmeasurable jitter for amazing clarity and definition, and it offers exceptional noise immunity via a galvanically-isolated design. It boasts an analog input, headphone output, and line-level output. It easily streams music from such sources as a Mac or Windows computer, music server, iPod/iPhone, Apple TV, Airport Express, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Squeezebox. 'Class A' Headphone Stage The DACmini PX has a superb sounding 'Class A' headphone stage that can drive virtually any headphones with very low distortion. The headphone stage has no capacitors in the signal path and offers clarity, a large soundstage, and freedom from listening fatigue. The power amplifier with beautiful 25-watt-per-channel power output uses a design that is based on the next-generation 'Class D' technology. It easily drives the majority of bookshelf speakers. Placed near your computer monitor, the DACmini PX becomes the core of a very powerful and versatile desktop audio setup.  \n \nSpecs Resolution: 24-bit (Also supports 16-bit) Sample Rate USB: Up to 96kHz, S/PDIF: Up to 192 kHz Interface: USB 2.0,driverless Local clock: 10 ppm precision Nominal Output level: +6.0dBV (RCA outputs) Frequency Response: 20Hz-40kHz; +0.0dB/-0.1dB (Line or Digital inputs) S/N Ratio: (A-wght) 144dB (Line inputs); 113dB (Digital inputs) Crosstalk: -128dB/118dB (Line / Digital Inputs) Output Impedance: 25 / 10 Ohms (Lineout / Headphone output-out) Output Power: 1.5W, drives 32-600 Ohm headphones Max Output level: +13.5dBV (32 Ohms load), +18.6dBV (300 Ohms load), +19.0dBV (600 Ohms load) Audio Output: RCA line-out, stereo 1/4\\\" headphone out  \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/01616_jWX5tEHhaN9_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_lWBBbZU7UY4_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01313_bvUqDODgNWo_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_eioCRLtGQmW_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.249074", "lng": "-121.857710", "postId": "5932970366", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/ele/5932970366.html", "postDate": "2016-12-26T02:41:36-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-10T01:52:37-0800", "attributes": "like new Centrance Dacmini PX 15 x 10 x 4 inches", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/ele/5932970366", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:49:19.967814", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

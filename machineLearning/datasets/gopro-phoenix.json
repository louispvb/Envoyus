I thought id have time to finish the truck before summer hit but the way things are looking currently it would have to wait till next year. I work in the HVAC industry and we are currently builsy.

Check quantities below, there are only a few left. Prices have also been lowered for a quick sale.** \n \nHello, I'm selling (20) of our Dell Latitude Intel Core 2 Duo business laptops that were used in a professional, clean environment - never personal use/etc. Latitude laptops are Dell's high-end enterprise grade machines and are built to last. These are all relatively low-use and in great condition. \n \nIntel Core 2 Duo processor (P8700 2.53ghz), 2GB of RAM, Intel HD graphics, wifi, fingerprint reader (on most), webcam, 15\" high resolution screens, VGA and DisplayPort video out, eSATA port, DVD RW, good batteries (a few have extended life batteries), power supplies included, and a clean installation of Windows 10 Professional already activated with Microsoft, upgraded properly from Windows 7 Pro. \n \nThese come installed with 128GB Samsung SSD (solid state) hard drives. The price is $160 for the SSD laptops; we can also upgrade the RAM before you come pick them up to 4GB for $10 more (while supplies last). This is recommended for Windows 10, you can easily upgrade the RAM yourself in the future - it's a very simple procedure on these. \n \n(4) Laptops with 128GB Samsung solid state drives remaining - $140 \n \nPriced for a quick private sale; I'm open to offers for purchasing multiple laptops or all at once. Please contact me by email at first with any questions or for my contact information. They have all been cleaned, updated, tested and are 100% ready to go. I'm located in NE Mesa, near the point on the map.

NO! IT'S HERE NOW!! < < < \n \n> > > FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED < < < > > > FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED < < < \n \n$ $ $ $ $ - - 1 OF 3, SOLD! ONLY 2 LEFT, NOW!! - - $ $ $ $ $  \n \n* * * NOTE * * *  \nWhereas I am firm on the pricing of the three \"large pack bundles\" and the remaining \"daypack bundles,\" my intent in selling these items is not only to recoup a (very) FEW bucks, but to also get rid of the inventory. Therefore, those who buy the already low-priced LARGE pack and Daypack bundles, I am more than willing to throw in a few extras of your choice -- and/or negotiate an even lower price on the extra item/s (provided they're still available). \n \nFor the purpose of full disclosure, over the years, I have sampled/tested several different brands and models of backpacks, in return for honest feedback regarding their functionality, size, weight and comfort, etc. Though I've never been paid to do this, I was obviously allowed to keep the backpacks regardless of the feedback. One of the companies was Outdoor Products (OP), though it \"was not\" the particular daypack I'm offering below. I've never sampled or accepted anything from Alps Mountaineering. Over three years ago, I chose the two backpacks offered below based solely upon their versatility, exceptional construction, price and 101 other reasons -- all based upon my first-hand experience in the field with them.  \n \nAlso see my listing for 12 expertly hand-painted, camouflaged 5-Gal Buckets and GAMMA SEAL Lids! \nhttp://phoenix.craigslist.org/cph/for/\n  \nhtml \n \nGreetings! \n \nA Little History: \nI am finally getting around to selling the remaining inventory I have from my little start-up business, \"The Dual-Survival Backpack,\" from several years ago. In 2012/13, I had the great idea of offering to the public, a backpack that was fully and completely equipped to go off the grid for between 3-6 days. The idea, I thought (and still do!!), was to have the well-equipped backpack available for people who were looking for a very solid pack -- be they beginning or experienced hikers -- either for just getting away for a few days for a fun-filled time with Mother Nature, or in the event of some kind of disaster/civil unrest/act of terrorism, etc., as a bugout bag.  \n \nAfter I sold several, I suffered two major back-to-back, untreated concussions, while . . . you guessed . . . hiking. Being propelled by a rock hidden in the tall grass, and falling forehead-first on a ground level boulder, just ain't good for ya! The first concussion of the \"two in five days,\" actually caused the second fall and concussion. \n \nAnyhoo, due to the lingering effects of those two concussions (and others, prior:), I found I no longer had what it took to run the business, and kind of closed up shop. Today, I still have some inventory left over that I would finally like to get rid of AT VERY LOW PRICES!! Every single item has been tested backwards and forwards, and I stand by everything to be the best you can buy for the money. And that's NOT to say that any element of these packs are cheaply made; they're NOT!  \n \nI don't have all the items that went into the original DSBP pack -- yet I'm not charging the original selling price of $1,100, either. However, the meat-and-potatoes are still in there. No food items are included in these packs.  \n \nEVERY ITEM OFFERED IS BRAND NEW! It \"may\" (and I mean MAY) have been used in a photo shoot or two, but never used! Each LARGE pack (see below); Brand New! * Sleeping bags; Brand New! * Day packs; Brand New! * Stoves; Brand New! * Sleeping bag mats; Brand New! *** ALL of the other items? BRAND NEW! *** Still, everything sold \"as is\" because of maybe a blemish or two on it??? But everything sold is in 110% working condition! \n  \n$ $ $ $ $ - - 1 of 3 LARGE PACKS ALREADY SOLD! ONLY 2 LEFT, NOW!! - - $ $ $ $ $  \n \nAs I said, I am selling the items in as many \"bundles\" as I can, thus I've broken down the sale three ways: \n \n1)\tLARGE Packs -- $350. ea. (see below) include all the items shown in the photos of that particular bundle. If you're just starting out, or you have a friend who needs a very well stocked, LARGE, long-haul backpack, you can't beat this for price and quality -- guaranteed!!! Were you thinking about trekking a LONG, multi-WEEK trail in one of our beautiful National Parks soon? This is your answer!! \n \nI spent literally weeks-at-a-time testing every part included it in my DSBP packs, making sure that those items that made the final cut, were up to a standard of quality that I was happy to stand behind. Everything that made up my DSBP packs was tested in every temperature and element Arizona has to offer, including four-days in a miserable wet snow storm in Flagstaff, several October days/nights in Utah and horrendous monsoon season thunderstorms, with all the high winds and downpours they can offer and temperatures as high as 105-degrees, during the summer. To this day, dollar-for-dollar, I would change only one or two things about it; THAT'S IT! \n  \n2)\tDaypacks -- $35. ea. is a STEAL! Do your research . . . I have 10 additional Daypacks that I am selling, and including for FREE, my own, personally made Wilderness First-Aid Kit, a $45. value! This homemade Kit has everything you need, and nothing you don't, for heading off-trail or hiking. As long as supplies last, I'm happy to throw in extras -- also at no additional charge -- such as bug spray, etc., and sell other items, if you're interested, at discounted prices (AS LONG AS SUPPLIES LAST). \n \n3)\tRemaining additional items sold singly, or in quantities (WHILE SUPPLIES LAST, Ssee below): \n_______________________________________________________ \n \nList of Items Bundled With LARGE Pack (ONLY! $350. ea):  \n- - 1 of 3 LARGE PACKS ALREADY SOLD! ONLY 2 LEFT, NOW!! - - \n \n*  Alps Mountaineering, Cascade 5200 (See the first two photos and list below for included items) \nThis is the best, simplest, most well constructed large -- or small -- backpack I've ever owned, and I've own/owned many backpacks! I've had my personal Cascade 5200 for over five years now, and have logged-in well over a thousand miles with this pack on my back (usually weighing in at least 45-50 lbs. fully loaded, with two, full, 3L hydration packs inside). With only three of these left, you might think I'd keep one for myself, but I'm not. My Cascade 5200 shows no signs of giving up -- even in the next five years!  \n \nThe capacity of this monster is 5200 cubic-inches, 85-liters. To give you an idea of its size, you can place a 2L bottle of soda in each SIDE pocket, with room to spare. The included fanny pack (which can also be used as a pack \"topper\"), could probably hold two, 2L bottles of soda, but it certainly holds one with much room to spare (See photos). Not that I condone carrying around 2L bottles of soda, just using them as a visual. \n  \nMore info can be found via the following link. Keep in mind my packs are \"olive green,\" and although they are brand new and unused, they do have a little patch of my company logo affixed to the front, as I used them in photo shoots. \nhttp://www.alpsmountaineering.com/products/packs/internal-frame-packs/cascade-5200 \n \n* * * THE FIRST PERSON TO PURCHASE ONE OF THESE BUNDLES WILL ALSO RECEIVE A PLATYPUS 3L RESERVOIR/BLADDER -- FREE! FREE! FREE! (Sorry, this unit was sold to a very happy buyer, yesterday! You still have a 2L reservoir that comes w/the below-listed Daypack and/or can purchase additional PLATYPUS 3L reservoirs online!) * * * \n \n*  2 L  Hydration Daypack; Outdoor Products, Ripcord  \n*  Tent; Hi-Tec V-Lite 1 (or V-Lite 2; a two-person version of the V-Lite 1 -- First come, first served on choice of tent size. I can make an argument for both. Contact me if your interested.) \n*  Sleeping Bag, Mummy; Suisse Sport, Alpine  \n*  Pad, Sleeping Bag; Stansport, Pack Lite \n*  Footprint; 6' x 8' Moisture Barrier for Tent, has many other uses \n* Wilderness First-Aid Kit; Handmade by myself based on years of experience and training in Wilderness First-Aid. Easily, a $45. value. I'll put my F-A Kit up against anybody's on the Net. Items included are too much for me to list -- see the photos or write me with any questions \n* Portable Water Filter; Frontier Pro Ultra-Light, Multi-Use \n* Stove Ware AND Stove \n*  Extra-Long Spoon; Super easy to clean. The only utensil I used/sold w/Mountainhouse Freeze-Dried Pouches incl in my packs \n*  Cup; Coleman, also used as a 1\u00bd-cup measuring cup \n*  Knee Pads; QEP Comfort Grip \n*  Gloves, Leather; Wells Lamont. Unless you want a different size than \"Large\" with your pack, please contact me ASAP, as I'm selling the others to the open public!

The tank has been upgraded to a acerbis 5.5 gallon desert tank with dual petcocks. It has pro taper bars with risers, and bark busters.  \nI did a top end rebuild a few hundred miles ago. New piston, piston rings, and valve  \nJob. I also replaced the timing chains and guides. \n \nThe sprocket have been changed to allow it to ride on the road easier. \nThe tire are dot approved knobbies. \nIt also has trail tech LCD display, but the speed sensor is not working at this time. \nThe exhaust is a super trapp IDS2. \nIt is registered and plated(no turn signals though). \nIt has a 130 w stator from the factory, so you can put a desert light on without a stator upgrade. \n \n \nThis bike is for tall people. Anyone under six foot will have very hard time with it. \nI know how hard it is to find a bike to suit taller/heavier people. \nIf you are of larger proportion, this should fit you much better than the others. \nthe title is notarized and ready to go! \n \n \nThanks for looking, \nI do not need help selling this bike! \nI would consider a trade for a working name brand(miller, Lincoln, etc.) tig and stick welder with argon bottle and accessories. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nxr Honda 600r 600 dirt bike motorcycle dual sport enduro klr bmw r1150 ktm  \nAdventure xr650r xr650l 650 500 off-road yz kx  \n \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_8KPlsS1WTQN_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00606_6UidmS1yhzt_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01111_HDuudxa2Tf_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_h9E9BHylVSX_600x450.jpg"], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5939379603", "postingUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/mcy/5939379603.html", "postDate": "2016-12-30T17:29:15-0700", "updateDate": "2017-01-10T12:53:57-0700", "attributes": "1988 honda xr600r good 600 gas white clean manual", "locAccuracy": "medium", "sellerUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/mcy/5939379603", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:07:24.812433", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

It is a great looking and awesome sounding versatile kit!  With 4 toms you can really adjust to the style and genre of music you want to play. \n \nI am willing to sell with or without hardware - it all needs to go. \n \nGMS Drums are a boutique drum manufacturer from NY and make some amazing drums!  http://gmsdrums.com/ This is a kit built in 1996 that features maple shells with a white lacquer finish.  (see photo with stamp, they are all stamped but I didn't photo each one) \n1996 was the year they introduced their proprietary suspension mounting system as is featured on these drums. \nThese are without a doubt some of the best sounding drums I've had the chance to own \n \nSpecs: \n24\" Bass \n10\", 12\", 13\", 16\" Toms \n14\"x6\" Snare - matching maple \n \nTom heads are within a year old, never gigged with them and are Evans 360 2-ply heads, nice versatile sound, with a good balance of attack and resonance.  Snare has a Remo Controlled Sound coated head.  Drum kick head is an Evan Emad 2 with dampening ring (don't know the age) and the bass resonant head is the original with the GMS logo, the previous owner had put a piece of tape on a tear, doesn't affect the sound too much that I can tell but doesn't look the best either.    \n \nThe hardware is a bit of a mixed bag including Gibraltar hi hat (also a ludwig hi hat stand) (2) DW double braced boom/straight combo cymbal stands and a Tama single braced boom/straight combo cymbal stand, also a DW 5000 double chain single bass pedal.  There are a few misc. hardware pieces that I can include as welL. \n \nCymbals: \n14\" hi hat including ZHT Mastersound on top and Zildjian Aveidas on bottom. \n18\" A Custom Zildjian Crash \n20\" Sabian El Sabor Ride  \n14\" Sabian B8 Crash \n  \nThese drums are 21 years old and are in really great, but not perfect shape; however dollar for dollar these rival or top the likes or similar drum company's high end line of drums. There's not many of these being sold around the country, look around and you will see. \nI am open to offers, contact me to discuss more.

Fret not, I got you covered, remember when I said total computing solution? \n \nSo I am including with this machine - A docking station/port replicator that will send outputs to three different displays (that's a lotta desktop) as well as add an additional. \n \nWhen you plug this dock into the lenovo you will instantly add the following ports to the Carbon X1 \n \n2 x USB 3.0 -- 1 provides always-on mobile device charging \n2 x USB 2.0 \n1 x DVI-D \n1x Gigabit Ethernet \n1x Stereo/Mic Combo Port \n \nSo in other words, you can leave a wireless mouse, wireless keyboard, a larger external display, a printer, and an external DVD drive plugged in to the stationary dock, and when you get home, plug the dock into your carbon and your home office springs to life.   \n \nIt's a pretty damn cool setup.  My price may seem high, but there's a reason for that.  I've done all the work for you, and am including several accessories.  this is ready to go. \n \nTHIS WILL ALSO COME WITH A FULLY ACTIVATED COPY OF MS OFFICE 2016 PROFESSIONAL PLUS & PHOTOSHOP CS6 PREINSTALLED ON THE COMPUTER.   \n \nComputer is Mint \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_d2emWO8uWmK_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_fGDx6c9PX3m_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_6MkmElPe4U1_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_38b4Fo8iaaR_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00303_61XrFgCaIgI_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_b5VTv5XtIUe_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00W0W_fdVZAVa5ZV_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01313_9eAXftAHIY9_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00O0O_5QyptE4UVy5_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_cIIIBrdxKj0_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_cZGi3WULp91_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_3fylxcu7F1q_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00W0W_iRUyYKjvWMw_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_3n2ctOGgMSH_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01010_bR7E3yrRT7g_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01515_arppA0TL5Rq_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_fwJZNYVKx0f_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_aIZEYETHmN9_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "33.596541", "lng": "-112.032604", "postId": "5914303007", "postingUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/nph/sys/5914303007.html", "postDate": "2016-12-10T17:57:29-0700", "updateDate": "2017-01-09T11:15:20-0700", "attributes": "like new lenovo x1 carbon 14\"", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/sys/5914303007", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:07:29.739164", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "Brand NEW!! Martin Logan Montis ( RESERVE SERIES with 5 year WARRANTY!", "price": null, "priceUnit": null, "cityName": null, "description": "\n         \nHello everybody,  I have a Brand New set of Martin Logan Montis  ( RESERVE SERIES ) the speakers come with a 5 year warranty and are just Beautiful! The CURRENT list price STARTS at $10,000! I am ONLY asking  $6,900 for the pair. I have all the original boxes, manuals, spikes, dust covers ect. \nI bought the Montis on 12/15/2016 from Precision Audio which is a Reserve level Authorized Martin Logan Dealer. The Montis arrived via Pilot Freight on 12/22/2016 and  I currently have them hooked up to a Mcintosh Mc402 amplifier, This combo is just Magical! I hate to let these AMAZING electrostatic hybrids go but I underestimated the space needed to get  optimal performance from them, I have an awkward living room configuration and having the Montis in the correct and proper locations really limits my entry way through the living room so I rather sell them to someone who can get the full use and performance out of them than rather risk accidental  damage with my room restrictions. \nThe imaging, sonic clarity, and 3d spaciousness is unreal! You can really hear every different instrument used and where they are located with the main vocalist dead center!  \nPlease No Low Ball Offers, ONLY serious buyers with cash in hand will be allowed to Audition them. \nPlease feel free to Call/Text with any questions. \n\n  \n \nDaniel. \n \nMore info on the Montis \n \nhttp://www.martinlogan.com/montis/ \n \n \n \n \nOled,suhd,samsung,led

While we are a new company, our roots are very much in the past. Most of our molds are from some of the oldest companies in the business & were used to create some very famous cars!  Like our  '32 Austin Bantam (\"Pure Hell\") - Fiat Topolino (\"Magic Muffler\", \"Milodon\", \"Mondello & Matsubara\") 2 versions of the \"Marcellus & Borsch\" 23 T, \"Deuce\" roadster,  27 T roadster, 23 T \"Tub\" & 2 other T \"Buckets\" all original \"Fiberglass by Cal Automotive\" molds..... our  Austin A-40 sedan and pickup are the original \"Contemporary Fiberglass\" molds.... We have '40-'41 Willys components and a '23 T with 1 opening door from Jim Kirby's \"Challenger Components\" molds.      \n Others are molds that were made from some very famous cars, like our chopped 33 Willys, pulled from the original 'Brasher & Cummings' Gasser by \"Pacific Fiberglass\" in 1980.... All were made by some of the oldest \"fiberglass hands\" in the business...  \n We also have about 50 part numbers in our \"Scoops & Spoilers\" section that are original \"A&A Fiberglass\" molds. These range from the early Gasser & Super Stock stuff thru the \"Dyno Don\" & \"Sox & Martin\" Pro Stock up to some of the early 90's Aero stuff... Also Corvette, Camaro & Mustang \"Muscle Car' scoops like the L-88. Z-L1, Z-28, Cobra Jet, etc.  Rear Spoilers for '67 - '81 Camaro, Universal & a few 1990's \"Aero\" style. \n Are you building a \"period correct\" vintage race car or Hot Rod?

{"title": "Jeep Wrangler JK Lift, Tires, Wheels and Heavy Duty Tire Carrier", "price": "5000", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Chandler", "description": "\n         \nURBAN KRAWLER PACKAGE!! \n \n- Are you looking for the best combination of parts that allows your Jeep Wrangler JK to be both a comfortable daily driver as well as a capable weekend off-road rig? \n \n- Is it confusing trying to pick out all of the lift components you want or need - what height should you go, what size tire can you fit, will you need to re-gear the axles?? \n \n- Do you hate shops that don't listen to your needs, that don't explain exactly what you're buying or that try to sell you parts that are more of a benefit to them than you? \n \n- What brand is best - do you choose AEV, TeraFlex, Rubicon Express, Rock Krawler, Pro Comp or Rough Country?? \n \n- Do you want to trust your expensive Jeep to a shop that actually drives Jeeps themselves and has been building Jeeps since 2001, including Jeeps for major automotive aftermarket manufacturers like TeraFlex, Bushwacker, Truck-Lite/Rigid Industries, Rugged Ridge, BOLT Lock, Grizzly Coolers and Rhino Linings to name just a few? \n \nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, then Doetsch Off-Road is your solution! We only deal with Jeep Wranglers and are THE best at what we do. Our showroom is stocked full of Jeep Wrangler parts & accessories and is affectionately called the \"Jeep Candy Store\"! \n \nFor a limited time, we're offering stage 1 of our most popular Jeep Wrangler JK build package, called the \"Urban Krawler\", at a special price of only $5,000 OUT THE DOOR - that's all parts, supplies, labor, tax, alignment, tire/wheel mount & balance plus transfer of your OEM tire pressure monitoring sensors (TPMS), lug nuts, heavy duty spare tire carrier....EVERYTHING IS INCLUDED!! \n \nHere's what you get in the Urban Krawler Stage 1 package: \n \n**SUSPENSION** \n- A TeraFlex 2.5\" Suspension lift with shocks, which is an ultra simple performance oriented lift kit that provides amazing highway drivability with very capable off road performance. Drivability and performance are the most important factors that are engineered and built into every TeraFlex lift kit. Properly developed suspension geometry, roll center, and load tuning ensure that all factory stability controls remain functional and within the parameters that Jeep originally engineered into the vehicle. TeraFlex kits drive straight and will crawl anything, getting you there and back! This kit includes 2.5\" lift coil springs, 9550 VSS shock absorbers, rear swaybar links, heavy duty rear trackbar axle bracket, bumpstop extensions and all necessary hardware.  \n**You can also upgrade to our Stage 2 package which includes a 3\" TeraFlex lift, front adjustable monster trackbar and control arm drop brackets, by simply paying the difference. We also offer shock upgrades to brands like Bilstein or Fox!* \n \n**TIRES** \n- Five 35x12.50R18 (295/70R18) Nitto Trail Grappler tires (includes a matching spare tire) which are road and trail proven. Just Google this tire and read the reviews from other Jeep owners! For off-road performance, the 3-ply sidewall and thick rubber construction increase puncture resistance. On the tread surface, the blocks provide additional biting edges that command lateral stability and enhance forward traction. For on-road comfort, Nitto's engineers used advanced sound analysis equipment to systematically reduce noise levels commonly associated with off-road tires for a quieter drive. \n \n**WHEELS** \n- Your choice of any five (spare included) matching 18x9/18x10 KMC, XD Series or ATX Series Wheels that we have in stock....like the XD126 Enduro Pro, XD127 Bully, XD128 Machete, XD798 Addict, XD807 Strike, XD811 RS2 or AX195 Cornice! \n \n**LUG NUTS** \n- You probably don't want your original nasty chrome lug nuts to clash with your brand new wheels, so we included a complete black splined lug nut kit that features a total of 23 lugs and a spline key - that's enough to outfit all four tires plus your spare! \n \n**HEAVY DUTY TIRE CARRIER** \n- Don't try to run an oversized tire on the wimpy factory tire carrier and there's also no need to replace your rear bumper just yet just so you can have an aftermarket swing away tire carrier - we include the Rugged Ridge Spartacus HD Tire Carrier System and it also allows you to keep your OEM 3rd brake light. This kit provides the ultimate in strength and stability for mounting your oversized wheel and tire. Functionally designed to manage the amplified force and vibrations produced during extreme off-road conditions. The precision die-cast aluminum Hinge Casting provides maximum strength without the excess weight of steel. The one-piece design maintains one-handed access to cargo area and rigidly links the Wheel Mount to the reinforced section of the rear quarter panel. This, in combination with forged steel hinge brackets and hardened steel pins, results in far superior load capacity than the factory tailgate hinges, thereby effectively reducing wear and increasing longevity. The Wheel Mount lifts the mounting position and incorporates depth and tilt adjustability for large diameter and wide tire options. Tested to MIL-STD-810 to simulate extended duration of vigorous off-road driving conditions. Rated for up to and including 37\" wheel tire combinations. Includes adjustable third brake light bracket. Compatible with OE and most aftermarket rear bumpers. No drilling required. \n \n**ALL LABOR, FEES & TAXES** \n- All the labor to install the lift, perform a professional 4-wheel alignment after the lift is installed, mount & balance your five wheels & tires PLUS move over your original Tire Pressure Sensors (TPMS) to the new wheels/tires and the labor to install the Rugged Ridge HD tire carrier system. \n \nSo that's everything you need to start the build of a capable off-road trail Jeep while still keeping the on road handling that you may be used to. We also offer additional package accessories like steel aftermarket front AND rear bumpers for $350 (front or rear), Power Dome style hoods for $399, front or rear catch-all rubber floor mats for $60, LED cube lights starting at $100 for a pair plus a whole lot more!! We can easily add anything yo want to the package. \n \nThe package components listed above apply to any 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 r 2017 Jeep Wrangler JK or JKU Unlimited regardless if it is a Sport, Sahara, Rubicon, Hard Rock, Willys Edition, Polar Edition, 10th Anniversary Rubicon, Rubicon X, Black Bear Edition, etc. We also offer separate CJ, YJ and TJ packages so just call us for details! \n \nPics show some examples of the Urban Krawler Stage 1 package installed on various Jeeps, some of which have other optional accessories installed such as flat style fender flares, aftermarket bumpers from brands like JCR Offroad / Poison Spyder / Smittybilt / Rock Hard / Rampage and more!, LED lighting, roof racks, exhaust systems and more! All of which we also sell and can bundle into the package for even more savings!!

Check quantities below, there are only a few left. Prices have also been lowered for a quick sale.** \n \nHello, I'm selling (20) of our Dell Latitude Intel Core 2 Duo business laptops that were used in a professional, clean environment - never personal use/etc. Latitude laptops are Dell's high-end enterprise grade machines and are built to last. These are all relatively low-use and in great condition.  \n \nIntel Core 2 Duo processor (P8700 2.53ghz), 2GB of RAM, Intel HD graphics, wifi, fingerprint reader (on most), webcam, 15\" high resolution screens, VGA and DisplayPort video out, eSATA port, DVD RW, good batteries (a few have extended life batteries), power supplies included, and a clean installation of Windows 10 Professional already activated with Microsoft, upgraded properly from Windows 7 Pro. \n \nThese come installed with 128GB Samsung SSD (solid state) hard drives.  The price is $160 for the SSD laptops; we can also upgrade the RAM before you come pick them up to 4GB for $10 more (while supplies last). This is recommended for Windows 10, you can easily upgrade the RAM yourself in the future - it's a very simple procedure on these. \n \n(4) Laptops with 128GB Samsung solid state drives remaining - $160 \n \nPriced for a quick private sale; I'm open to offers for purchasing multiple laptops or all at once.  Please contact me by email at first with any questions or for my contact information. They have all been cleaned, updated, tested and are 100% ready to go. I'm located in NE Mesa, near the point on the map.  Thanks! \n______________________________  \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_dNr1UI4bUSA_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00B0B_bzM6IifQxC3_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_9TAWXqfnDCq_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01111_c7ETXQs5Yo1_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_lEmiQLX8WJo_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_dQxWZYiGckV_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "33.476717", "lng": "-111.701313", "postId": "5953139977", "postingUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/sys/5953139977.html", "postDate": "2017-01-10T07:34:44-0700", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "excellent Dell Latitude E6500", "locAccuracy": "highest", "sellerUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/sys/5953139977", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:07:32.549784", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "1949 Chevy/ GMC pickup", "price": "75000", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "NW Peoria", "description": "\n         \n1949 GMC 3100 pickup truck. The truck is titled as a GMC, but it does have a Chevy front end on it. I have over 100 photos of the ground up build of my truck. This is a serious restoration/ modification build in which every single nut, bolt, wire, line, etc has been touched. Every inch of the truck is detailed.  \n5.7 LS engine dynoed at 325 hp at the wheels. Power adders include Comp camshaft, Pro Products intake manifold, K&N intake system, 3\" mandrel bent and tig welded exhaust, stainless headers, Frontrunner serpentine belt system, etc. The transmission is a 4l60e and was brand new from B&M. The rear end is a GM 12 bolt, rebuilt with new gears, bearings, seals, and limited slip.  \nChassis has G body suspension up front from Ridetech with adjustable coilovers with both height adjustment and dampening adjustments. The rear suspension is a custom built, fully adjustable, parallel 4 link with panhard bar and adjustable Ridetech coilovers. The big brake package has 13\" rotors all the way around and a CPP master cylinder and booster setup. The truck rolls on 20\"x8.5\" (front) and 20\"x10\" (rear) Intro billet wheels wrapped in 245/40r20 and 275/49r20 Toyo Proxes ST ii tires. All the suspension has been powder coated gloss black, the chassis and the rest of the components have been painted. The exhaust is ceramic coated from the headers all the way to the rear bumper.  \nThe exterior of the truck has been cleaned up of all rust and a few custom touches have been added, but it still retains a mostly stock appearance. It is painted a pearl white found on the newer Cadillacs. The under side of the 4 fenders, the engine compartment, the interior, and every where but the underside of the cab are all painted in the same manor as the parts you see. The underside of the cab, the cab floor, the inside of the firewall, under dash, and inside back wall of the cab have all been seam sealed, sealed, and bedlined. The bedfloor is oak and has been stained and clear coated.  \nThe interior is very comfortable for an old single cab truck. The dash has been treated to Dakota VHX gauges, new chrome dash trim with Hydrodipped inserts to match the bedfloor. The seat frame is original, but all the springs were removed in favor of all new webbing and foam for a much more comfortable seat. The door panels, kick panels, and center console are all custom built and everything has been wrapped in a leather like material. The stereo system includes a pioneer double din touch screen DVD unit, two sets of 6\" component speakers, two 10\" subs, and one 5 channel amplifier ... all from Rockford Fosgate. The truck also has a Vintage Air Gen ii AC system.  \nThe truck was an inside booth vehicle at Sema 2015 for the company that supplied me with the paint materials for the truck. It was the focus of several tech articles in Street Trucks magazine. It made the cover of Street Trucks magazine in 2016 as well. It also was featured in an episode of Auto Revolution.  \nI'm sure I'm missing some details, but I think you'll get the idea from that. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I've put over 1,100 miles on the truck since it's been \"done.\" So, please don't think it's only a trailer queen. Because of the fact that I've driven it, it's not 100% perfect. However, it's darn close... especially the main parts of what you see. You won't be able to go anywhere without compliments! \nPrice is an asking price. Feel free to negotiate. I'm open to offers. I am not open to trades though. I have a 3 year old and another son due next month. So I just don't have the need for the truck now, or anytime in the near future.   \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_5ISGMqqzgHw_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_dSBq4MCDyaY_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_hmwJIlUMVf6_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_dNwsw9HIgDm_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_a82IcHPWsrT_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_3ASIumEsQP7_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00R0R_ikzDpiPLfG8_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_2J0cQenadEb_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_as4A5fH7sEO_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_6elDCzoIX9j_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_51YrZoXaPcZ_600x450.jpg"], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5943088155", "postingUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/nph/cto/5943088155.html", "postDate": "2017-01-02T21:34:19-0700", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "1949 Chevy GMC 3100 excellent 8 cylinders rwd gas 1100 white clean automatic pickup", "locAccuracy": "medium", "sellerUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/cto/5943088155", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:07:43.372531", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

Get up to 64 voice polyphony for each sound, plus choke, legato, and glide control. Vintage MPC 60 and SP1200 sampling modes deliver the feel of classic drum machines with all the advantages of modern software. And new 8-point sample interpolation is twice as accurate as MASCHINE 1, delivering incredible sample quality.  \n \nSlice \nSlice your samples with laser-like precision. Find the flavor that fits you best with four different modes: \nDetect Mode detects your sample's transients and creates slices based on sensitivity settings. With automatic zero-point detection, MASCHINE 2.0 positions markers at the point where the sound wave crosses the zero axis so every slice is pop- and click-free. \nGrid Mode slices your samples according to grid divisions you select. The slices are then cut on the grid itself. \nSplit Mode slices the sample into equal parts. Select from 4, 8, 16 or 32 slices per sample. \nManual Mode lets you add slices anywhere in the sample. Set any amount of slice markers per sample -- great for easily adding slice markers to an entire song and not just a defined region. \nMaschine makes it easy to demo your slices by automatically assigning each slice to one of Maschine Studio's 16 high-sensitivity pads. Quickly cycle through them and make adjustments on the fly on 8 display knobs.  \n \nEdit \nImport REX2 and MPC sample formats or import your personal sample library. Maschine Studio handles it all easily. Get creative with a full toolbox of destructive editing features including truncate, normalize, reverse, cut, copy, paste, fade-in, fade-out, silence, DC correct, and duplicate. Maschine's acclaimed offline timestretching and pitchbending with automatic beat detection deliver unrivaled sample quality.  \n \nDrum Synth \nCreate your own electronic and acoustic drum sounds in truly peerless sound quality. Five monophonic drum plug-ins built exclusively for Maschine 2.0, each with several unique algorithms give you any percussive sound you need. All fully tweakable, automatable from the hardware, and perfectly integrated into Maschine Studio -- with the quality that comes from NI's acclaimed DSP expertise.  \n \nKick Plug-In \nEach of the kick plug-in's eight sound engines delivers unique, powerful low end. Three engines are based on classic analog machines made famous over thirty years of electronic music. They deliver sounds fat and punchy to deep and dusty, and everything in between.  \n \nSnare Plug-In \nThe snare plug-in features nine different sound engines. Create any imaginable electronic snare -- the snare plug-in does thin, harsh, bold, deep, and filtered with equal ease. Acoustic-like sounds are the sonic wonders of this plug-in -- recreate not only the sound of real snare drums, but also completely change their character and tuning with the turn of a knob.  \n \nHi-Hat Plug-In \nGet classic analog hi-hats, digital, robotic sounds from a complex oscillator, or ultra-modern synthesis from Fast Fourier Transform data of analyzed and reconstructed hi-hat samples. This data gives you ultra-powerful synthesis without having to use samples at any stage of sound production. And quick tweaks deliver other percussion possibilities outside the range of simple hi-hat sounds for endless versatility.  \n \nTom Plug-In \nThree tom engines let you intuitively craft a full set of toms fast. Digital sounds from percussive to bell-like to completely alien. And acoustic sounds so warm and fat you won't believe they're not samples. Added control over pitch bend and mute parameters give you a flexible set of sounds that are ultra-intuitive to create.  \n \nPercussion Plug-In \nThe percussion plug-in features three sound engines and a world of possibility. Design any additional percussion your project needs from bell-like and metallic to sub-like and twisted with one engine. A second engine is dedicated to shaker and maraca sounds. The third is capable of rich, orchestral timpani sounds ready to add big symphonic percussion to any production.  \n \nInstruments Included \nMaschine Studio comes with four full-version KOMPLETE Instruments and Effects, worth over $400 in total. Each KOMPLETE Instrument is perfectly integrated into the Native Instruments Maschine Studio environment, with presets browsable from the hardware and tweakable via the eight display knobs -- automatically mapped to that instrument's parameters.  \n \nMASSIVE (synthesizer)  \nThe star of the Maschine library -- the legendary synthesizer for devastating bass and leads. MASSIVE gives you a total of over 1,300 sounds, all crafted by leading artists and sound designers. Hear it in action  \n \nREAKTOR PRISM (synthesizer)  \nA highly playable instrument and effects processor.

{"title": "TRAXXAS SLASH 1/10 2WD ELECTRIC SHORT COURSE TRUCK 58034-1", "price": "229", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Carefree Hwy/48th Street", "description": "\n         \nThe award-winning Traxxas Slash Short-Course Race Truck puts you in the drivers seat for intense fender-to-fender, high-flying off-road action. The full-scale Short-Course Race Trucks embody the spirit of Traxxas R/C with their extreme 900+ horsepower racing engines full-throttle, dirt-roosting power slides, giant suspension travel, and Supercross-style big-air jumps. The Traxxas Slash brings all the action home so you can experience the high-speed head-to-head competition at the track or in your own backyard. The Slash was inspired by the TORC\u2122 (THE Traxxas Off-Road Championship\u2122) Pro 2WD class. The Pro 2WD class specifies rear-wheel drive trucks purpose built to fly over jumps and rip full-throttle through the turns. The Traxxas Slash hangs it out for an all new way to challenge your driving skills. The 4-wheel independent suspension has been carefully tuned to replicate the Pro 2 driving and handling experience as closely as possible. The scale appearing tires provide just the right amount of bite and thick, blinding clouds of dirt roost. When the racing action cools down, the Traxxas Slash is well-equipped to tackle all of your off-track driving adventures. The long travel suspension and oil-filled shocks easily absorb jumps and rough terrain. The unique chassis design provides huge center ground clearance to drive over deep ruts, rocks, and other obstacles that leave ordinary R/C trucks stuck. The tires use advanced tread design and sophisticated rubber compounds to provide incredible grip off-road with enough versatility to also perform well on concrete and asphalt. The fenders cover the tires so you bang against your driving buddies without getting tangled up. The Revo-spec Torque-Control\u2122 slipper clutch design delivers smooth operation, precise adjustment, and consistent traction control. The bellcrank steering system virtually eliminates bump steer for precise handling and control. A digital steering servo delivers lightning fast response. Traxxas shocked enthusiasts with the release of our exclusive watertight, sealed electronics in the E-Maxx that provided the freedom to drive where you want to drive through water, mud, snow, and other wet-running conditions that wouldn't have been possible before. The proven XL-5 electronic speed control and the mini receiver are sealed against the elements giving you the freedom go places you might not have thought possible. It opens up a whole new world of adventure and fun. Wet muddy tracks are no problem for the Slash. The battery compartment makes it easy to install batteries and the clever design makes it quickly adaptable for either 6 or 7-cell running (hump packs or stick packs).The Titan 12T 550 modified motor is designed for incredible mod-motor power output with virtually maintenance-free operation, and long-lasting performance. The Titan 12T 550 motor's integrated cooling fan pulls cool air through the motor to keep temperatures down. Airflow is routed through vent tunnels molded in the motor plate. A cooler running motor equates to faster speeds, longer runtime, and extended motor life. The XL-5 Electronic Speed Control offers high current handling, EZ-Set\u00ae one-button setup, and smooth high-frequency control. Three drive profiles, low voltage detection, thermal shutdown protection, gold-plated connectors, and incredibly low resistance are all features you might expect to only be available on an expensive replacement ESC. As today's batteries store more and more energy inside their cells, traditional battery connectors could no longer keep up. The included patented Traxxas High-Current Connector opens the door for unrestricted current flow. With the TQ\u2122 2.4GHz radio system, you just switch on a drive. There are no channels or frequencies to manage, so the focus is on having fun. The TQ's ergonomic design is comfortable for all-day driving, and its sleek lines are enhanced by an internal antenna that is impervious to damage. Traxxas' exclusive patented Training Mode let's everyone get in on the racing action. Just press a button to limit full-throttle power to 50%. This allows young or new drivers to safely develop their control skills before unlocking full power to the mighty Titan 12T motor. The Slash is perfect for drivers at all experience levels. Training mode even makes it easy to hand the transmitter over to your friends who have never driven a radio controlled truck before. The Traxxas Slash model 58034 comes fully-assembled and Ready-To-Race\u00ae with the TQ radio system installed and adjusted, XL-5 power system, Power Cell 7-cell NiHM battery, wall charger, a painted and decaled body, pre-glued tires, and detailed instructions. There's a reason this powerful RC machine is a classic.

{"title": "2001 Dodge Ram Lifted", "price": "6500", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Mesa", "description": "\n         \nAre you tired of driving around in some un-American compact job? Are you tired of all of those pesky obstacles when you drive, such as parking curbs, priuses, and the occasional mountain? Are you over not being able to see into other peoples' cars and snoop in their business? Then I have the vehicle for you. \nThis bad boy is is lifted 2001 Dodge Ram 1500, and will get you wherever you need to go, as long as there is a gas station nearby. I bought this fine rig a few years ago with 88k on the odometer and haven't been able to keep my wrenches away from in since I brought it home. See below for the benefits of owning this fine piece of pure American baddassery.  \n \nThe Truck is a 2001 Dodge Ram 1500 Laramie Edition, equipped with A/C, power locks and windows, and the fire breathing, liberal roasting 5.9l V8 Magnum. It runs and drives just fine around the city and will cruise at 75 down the highway. The biggest issue I have with the truck is the the commie (Chrysler) bastards who built these trucks in this era used the most god awful clear coat known to man, so the paint is sun faded, and they used the same ass backwards technology in the dash caps, so they always crack. This dash has a few holes that you can fit a Tijuana hooker through, but I fixed that silly problem by throwing a dash cover over it and forgetting about it. The only other things on the truck that I know about are the clockspring in the steering wheel needed replaced, as well as the blend door is starting to go out. \n \nModifications- \n-RCD 6 inch lift, all spring in the front with true long arm suspension links (not the stamped stock control arms), lift blocks in the back. \n-35 inch Toyo Mud Terrains on Micky Thompson wheels. (May 015) 80% life. \n-Completely rebuilt rear axle (June 2015) with a Detroit Locker. \n-Completely rebuilt steering (August 2015) All Moog suspension tie rods and drag links, new steering box, Poison Spyder front diff cover \n-Flowmaster 50 series with turn downs.  \n-Rockford Fosgate 12 inch subs with Kicker amp behind the seat. Pioneer deck in the dash.  \n-Monster Transmission \"Mega Monster\" Rebuilt transmission, this was done less that 500 miles ago. It improves various weak spots of the transmission, the drivetrain is now good for 500 hp. (I had plans for a 408 stroker engine, but things have changed). Also replaced the oil pan and rear main engine seal. \n-Finally, the one thing that everyone questions me about, the mushroom. When I bought the truck it had an Airaid intake that sucked water whenever I hit a puddle, so I welded up a custom box for it to seal it up, and piped it through the hood into a mushroom cap off of a M35 military truck. It works well, I run the truck through mud bogging competitions with zero issues. It also catches peoples' eyes when driving, I have seen people almost crash because they were trying to figure out what it was instead of driving. I figure it's what a pretty lady feels like when she wears a low cut shirt and causes guys to trip over themselves as they walk by. \n \nEverything is going with the truck that is in the bed, I won't be pulling the toolbox or the jerry can, those are yours. The original \"full-size\" spare is under the bed, and there is a full 35 inch spare in the bed that will go along with the truck as well. The price is $6500obo. Please no trades or payments. Sweet green cash only. Call or text with questions, 520-5zero7-three60five. I will list the $1000 worth extra parts that I have in the toolbox that go along with it as well.

The system's digital-to-analog converters use an extremely high performance 192 kHz/24-bit operation type and perform accurate sound field reproduction for high-quality multichannel sources. And for two-channel stereo, they provide outstanding separation and precise musical delineation. In addition, the HTR-5850-SL has high-quality two-channel and multichannel surround reproduction and reproduces surround for 5.1 channels and 2.1 (virtual surround).

With 14 different sound programs that provide multiple variations, every movie and every piece of music will sound right in your home theater. Discrete power transistors, rather than chips, are used in the amplifier section to provide the cleanest sound possible. The amp delivers 105 watts each to seven channels, and the HTR-5850 can accommodate DVD, CD, MC/CDR, and digital TV/cable.

{"title": "Diamondback Carbon Racing Bike - 13lbs SRAM Red HED Carbon Wheels $8k", "price": "3500", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Ahwatukee", "description": "\n         \nDiamondback Podium Equipe Red 22 Road Bike (56cm). This bike weighs 13.5 lbs. That is insanely light. Most high-end sub $10,000 bikes weight 16lbs or higher. This bike is a rocket! \n \nI am asking $3,500 for the complete bike. Brand new, never ridden. PRICE JUST LOWERED! I need to sell this bike. \n \nThe retail price on this bike is $8,000. This is the same exact bike (frame and specs) that Diamondback's professional team races on. The frame technology comes from Cervelo and Look bikes. The components are the highest end SRAM set - SRAM Red 22 speed. The wheels are HED Stinger 4 Aero Carbon wheels. The wheels retail for $2100; the SRAM Red 22 set retails for $2,400. At my $4,000 asking price you are essentially buying the components and wheels and getting the frame and carbon parts for free. \n \nThe frame is 56cm - their size Medium / Large. It is designed to fit 5'9\" to 6'1\" heights. \n \nI bought this bike brand new for myself. It's too aggressive for my needs. I decided to go with a gravel bike instead. So I'm selling this Diamondback. \n \nYou can text me at 4-8-zero-four-four-2-four-zero-2-9. Mention that you are interested in the Diamondback bike when you text because I have a few bikes and things for sale on Craigslist. \n \n-- \n \nRoad Bike Actions has this to say about the Diamondback Podium Equipe Red 22: \n \nDiamondback took a balanced approach to ride quality rather than just going in with the stiffer-is-better approach. Even the pentagon-shaped downtube and rectangular chainstays aren't noticeably overbuilt. The top tube takes on a wide but quite thin profile, which is shared by the seatstays-both are clearly focused on compliance. As you'd expect from Diamondback's premier race bike, geometry is, well, racy. It uses parallel, 73-degree seat and head tube angles (56cm frame) with a 98.4cm wheelbase- pretty standard fare for the bike's intended purpose. \n \nStraight off the bat everyone agreed that it was one of the more comfortable pro race bikes we had ridden. The small vibrations that typically resonate through us when riding some other flagship race bikes were mostly absent on the Podium Equipe. \n \nAdding to the positive first impressions was its downright luxuriously light, 14-pound weight, which added to the enjoyment factor while climbing. Of course, you have to remember that the tubular HED wheels are a critical aspect to the bike's low weight and impressive ride quality. \n \n \n \nDiamondback Podium Equipe Red 22 Road Bike \n \nThe Diamondback Podium Equipe is a top of the line carbon competition road racing machine. From the aggressive carbon shapes to the latest internal cable housing design, this is the ultimate road frame. The frame comes in at under 900 grams thanks to the newly designed tapered Continuous Fiber Technology full carbon fork with integrated carbon crown race. Diamondback set out to create a road bike that is more user and performance friendly, not just for the top racers of the world but also the weekend road warriors that ride thousands of miles a year. \n \nDiamondback looked at the handling, feel, weight, and geometry of each frame and each size so they could make sure every product has the signature Diamondback feel. Then Diamondback does conceptual sketches, 3D Modeling, and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) before they even make the first steel mold. They set clear and concise goals to make the Podium a world-class frame and they strive to make an already incredible product. . .better. Diamondback feels that only after going through all these long, tedious processes that this is the only way to create a high performance racing bicycle worthy of the Podium badge. \n \nContinuous Fiber -- Diamondback's Continuous Fiber Technology uses full-length carbon strands to manufacture the fork that extend from the top of the steerer tube to the bottom of the drop outs. Using that same AMMP technology employed in the Podium frame, they've created one of the stiffest forks available. With a lower integrated crown race that's completely carbon, they've eliminated the need for a separate aluminum race.

This thing is LOUD!!! She may not be pretty but she sounds AMAZING!!! According to the original owners this was purchased in 1979. It looks like an MTI era SVT tho (the change happened in 1980). It is possibly one of the very early transition models but no way to know for sure. The serial number tag is missing from the back and I have not opened it to look inside. According to the original owners this was a rental that toured the country for years. Supposedly used by Jason Newsted in his Flotsam years, but again no way to know that for sure. Either way, this is a killer sounding amp. Both channels work great!  \n \nI bought this amp with the intention of refurbishing it and making it look as good as it sounds. Unfortunately I have a family situation that requires making some sacrifices. I am offering this head at the same price that I paid for it almost 2 months ago.  \n \nThe details: \n \nThe Good: \nThe head sounds like it should: loud, aggressive, growly, beautiful.  \nHead is solid and both channels work as they should.  \nGood overall physical condition with some tolex damage, but nothing major.  \nAll rocker switches work correctly. \nIt's a vintage Ampeg SVT!!! \n \nThe Bad: \nThe faceplate has clearly been written on with a paint pen but there are enough of the dial markings left to see what settings you are using.  \nFan is loud but you will NOT hear it while you are playing. \nOn/Off switch stays \"on\" so you just use the \"Standby\" switch  \nSlight tolex damage. \n \nLook at the pictures but the head does look better in person (because the pictures really suck). I really hate to sell this but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. The price is $700 FIRM and that is a LOCAL PICKUP PRICE ONLY!!!! I am not looking to ship this amp at this time. I am also not going to deal with you \"shipping agent\", accept a money order, or take payments.  \n \nIf you want that vintage Ampeg SVT sound for a lot less money then this is the amp for you. Please text me if you are interested and want to set up a test. I have a bass and speaker cab you can use to test it with.  \n \nGENZ BENZ 212 XB CAB  $200 OBO \n \nGenz Benz 212XB cab with adjustable tweeter in great condition. Handles 350 watts and is an 8 ohm cabinet and sounds fantastic with the SVT-100!!!

With a full 5.3\" of travel, the Mach 5 is positioned right between our Mach 4 and Mach 5.7, making it the ultimate trail bike with the soul of a cross country rig. It's meant to cover the spectrum of 24 hour racing and all-day in-the-saddle rides, with the ability to devour technical descents. \nWherever and whatever you ride, the Mach 5 will make your experience much more enjoyable. With 5.3\" of precision-tuned dw-link(r) travel, unparalleled frame stiffness, and our custom-tuned Fox suspension with Boost Valve technology, the Mach 5 delivers an incredibly efficient, balanced feel. Descend with confidence as your Mach 5 soaks up everything from small bumps to the biggest hits, delivering superior plushness and control. As the trail turns up, the Mach 5 exhibits exceptional climbing traction. If you had to own only one bike, the Mach 5 is it. \nThe ride: The Mach 5 has the distinction of winning the 2009 MTBR award for Best Full-Suspension All-Mountain Bike. With 5.3\" of travel, the Mach 5 is designed and built to be the ultimate bike for wherever your ride. The Mach 5 can easily conquer a 24-hour race one weekend, then bring a smile to your face the next weekend as you put in an all-day ride with friends on your favorite trail system. \nAnd when the terrain turns rough, the Mach 5 shines. We have tested this bike everywhere from South Mountain's National Trail to Moab's Porcupine Rim. The Mach 5 holds its line at speed and always seems to have extra travel in reserve for big hits, big drops, and even the occasional big jump. The Mach 5 features a dw-link(r) suspension design, which allows the bike to devour technical descents, yet avoids any inefficient, squishy feel. The head angle with the fork at 140mm travel is 69 degrees. This is a nice stable number for handling very technical terrain. The Mach 5 is all about achieving a balance in what we believe to be the perfect combination of incredible pedaling efficiency and frame stiffness with a controlled feel throughout the stroke and enough travel to keep our customers grinning from ear to ear in even some of the most technical terrain.  \n \nWelds: The Mach 5 uses a combination of traditional welds and smooth welds. The smooth welds on some bikes are polished out after being completed (a la Cannondale). We like the flat bead look of the smooth weld as it is laid down. We use it near on the top tube shock tab area to keep things smooth and snag free and on other areas because it actually reduces stress risers and makes for a nice strong joint.  \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_jRJlQKkWMU9_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_g2O1dMHmWwF_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_eNPTqrip3Tb_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "33.582591", "lng": "-111.978149", "postId": "5904054287", "postingUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/nph/bik/5904054287.html", "postDate": "2016-12-03T13:54:32-0700", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "Pivot Mach 5", "locAccuracy": "highest", "sellerUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/bik/5904054287", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:08:00.539543", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "TRAXXAS SLASH 1/10 2WD ELECTRIC SHORT COURSE TRUCK 58034-1", "price": "229", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "7830 E. Redfield Rd.", "description": "\n         \nThe award-winning Traxxas Slash Short-Course Race Truck puts you in the drivers seat for intense fender-to-fender, high-flying off-road action. The full-scale Short-Course Race Trucks embody the spirit of Traxxas R/C with their extreme 900+ horsepower racing engines full-throttle, dirt-roosting power slides, giant suspension travel, and Supercross-style big-air jumps. The Traxxas Slash brings all the action home so you can experience the high-speed head-to-head competition at the track or in your own backyard. The Slash was inspired by the TORC\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 (THE Traxxas Off-Road Championship\u00e2\u0084\u00a2) Pro 2WD class. The Pro 2WD class specifies rear-wheel drive trucks purpose built to fly over jumps and rip full-throttle through the turns. The Traxxas Slash hangs it out for an all new way to challenge your driving skills. The 4-wheel independent suspension has been carefully tuned to replicate the Pro 2 driving and handling experience as closely as possible. The scale appearing tires provide just the right amount of bite and thick, blinding clouds of dirt roost. When the racing action cools down, the Traxxas Slash is well-equipped to tackle all of your off-track driving adventures. The long travel suspension and oil-filled shocks easily absorb jumps and rough terrain. The unique chassis design provides huge center ground clearance to drive over deep ruts, rocks, and other obstacles that leave ordinary R/C trucks stuck. The tires use advanced tread design and sophisticated rubber compounds to provide incredible grip off-road with enough versatility to also perform well on concrete and asphalt. The fenders cover the tires so you bang against your driving buddies without getting tangled up. The Revo-spec Torque-Control\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 slipper clutch design delivers smooth operation, precise adjustment, and consistent traction control. The bellcrank steering system virtually eliminates bump steer for precise handling and control. A digital steering servo delivers lightning fast response. Traxxas shocked enthusiasts with the release of our exclusive watertight, sealed electronics in the E-Maxx that provided the freedom to drive where you want to drive through water, mud, snow, and other wet-running conditions that wouldn't have been possible before. The proven XL-5 electronic speed control and the mini receiver are sealed against the elements giving you the freedom go places you might not have thought possible. It opens up a whole new world of adventure and fun. Wet muddy tracks are no problem for the Slash. The battery compartment makes it easy to install batteries and the clever design makes it quickly adaptable for either 6 or 7-cell running (hump packs or stick packs).The Titan 12T 550 modified motor is designed for incredible mod-motor power output with virtually maintenance-free operation, and long-lasting performance. The Titan 12T 550 motor's integrated cooling fan pulls cool air through the motor to keep temperatures down. Airflow is routed through vent tunnels molded in the motor plate. A cooler running motor equates to faster speeds, longer runtime, and extended motor life. The XL-5 Electronic Speed Control offers high current handling, EZ-Set\u00c2\u00ae one-button setup, and smooth high-frequency control. Three drive profiles, low voltage detection, thermal shutdown protection, gold-plated connectors, and incredibly low resistance are all features you might expect to only be available on an expensive replacement ESC. As today's batteries store more and more energy inside their cells, traditional battery connectors could no longer keep up. The included patented Traxxas High-Current Connector opens the door for unrestricted current flow. With the TQ\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 2.4GHz radio system, you just switch on a drive. There are no channels or frequencies to manage, so the focus is on having fun. The TQ's ergonomic design is comfortable for all-day driving, and its sleek lines are enhanced by an internal antenna that is impervious to damage. Traxxas' exclusive patented Training Mode let's everyone get in on the racing action. Just press a button to limit full-throttle power to 50%. This allows young or new drivers to safely develop their control skills before unlocking full power to the mighty Titan 12T motor. The Slash is perfect for drivers at all experience levels. Training mode even makes it easy to hand the transmitter over to your friends who have never driven a radio controlled truck before. The Traxxas Slash model 58034 comes fully-assembled and Ready-To-Race\u00c2\u00ae with the TQ radio system installed and adjusted, XL-5 power system, Power Cell 7-cell NiHM battery, wall charger, a painted and decaled body, pre-glued tires, and detailed instructions.

{"title": "TRAXXAS SLASH 1/10 4X4 ELECTRIC SHORT COURSE TRUCK 68086-21", "price": "489", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "7830 E. Redfield Rd.", "description": "\n         \nThis Slash 4X4 is hard-loaded for ultimate performance and realism with the Traxxas On-Board Audio, new Traxxas Stability Management (TSM) and a low-CG chassis. Traxxas On-Board Audio delivers the full short course experience with the powerful and loud sound of a 900 horsepower engine ripping through the gears. While TSM and the Low CG chassis combine for a whole new level of speed and precision behind the wheel.  \n \nTraxxas Stability Management (TSM) allows you to experience all the extreme power, speed, and acceleration that was engineered into the Slash 4X4 by making it much easier to control on common slippery surfaces such as loose dirt, smooth concrete, and even ice and snow. Punch it off the line and TSM goes to work sensing the vehicle's direction and making steering corrections to provide straight-ahead full-throttle acceleration without fishtailing, spinouts, and loss of control. TSM also works during cornering, first making intuitive corrections to maintain your line, and then allowing you to hammer the throttle earlier in the turn for much faster exit speeds. Braking is dramatically improved as TSM works to keep you arrow straight until you come to a complete stop. TSM acts as your on-board co-pilot in the vehicle that \"feels\" what the vehicle is doing and makes corrections for vehicle movements that you cannot even detect, well before the vehicle gets out of control.  \n \nTraxxas TSM gives you all the benefits modern electronic stabilization has to offer without intruding on your driving fun. Traxxas engineers developed superior tuning algorithms that run on high-speed, precision electronic components to create a system that works invisibly, in the background, without ever limiting your throttle. TSM can be fine tuned (or turned off) for different surfaces by simply adjusting the multi-function knob on the TQi transmitter, or by adjusting the slider in the Traxxas link app. The result is that you are driving faster, with more ease, and having more fun,with that fully connected feeling at the controls that you expect. In fact, you may not even realize how much TSM is helping you until you turn it off and test your driving skills without it! \n \nOn-Board Audio System \nThe On-Board Audio System uses sound that has been sampled from Traxxas team trucks, including the Traxxas Pro 4 short course truck driven by Traxxas' Mike Jenkins. The ON/OFF button and volume controls let you adjust the system settings, stealth mode to wide-open. The system uses a minimal amount of power from the battery so your runtime is not compromised. The intuitive sounds respond to throttle input from the transmitter. Cruise around or rip full-throttle to hear the difference in engine RPM. If you're stopped for more than 10 seconds, the engine will shut off. Just tap the throttle to hear the engine fire back up! Use the rocker switch on the included 3-channel transmitter to shift to \"neutral\" and hear the engine revving. Flip the switch, and launch back into racing. \n \nClass-Leading Brushless Power \n \nSlash 4X4's Traxxas Velineon Brushless Power system defines a whole new generation of outrageous electric power that doesn't know limitations and boundaries. Pour in the voltage and out comes the speed in tidal waves of force harnessed by precision throttle control. For the uninitiated, prepare yourself... the sheer brutal power combined with the Slash 4X4's four-corner grip results in tire-melting acceleration and lightning fast speed. The Velineon 3s Brushless Power System features system components that work together as an optimized package, from the patented Traxxas High-Current connector to the custom-wound motor. It's engineered together from the start to deliver the ultimate in efficiency, speed, and run-time along with precision throttle response and refined control. It's brushless performance the Traxxas way: wicked fast and easy to use. Just plug it in and it works, no special knowledge or programming skills required. \n \nVelineon VXL-3s Electronic Speed Control \nThe Velineon VXL-3s speed control is loaded with high-grade technology to precisely deliver maximum power to the motor. It's engineered for today's battery technology and beyond. Two-stage low voltage detection allows full LiPo compatibility, including powerful 11.1-volt 3S packs! \n \nVelineon 3500 Brushless Motor \nExtreme performance is standard equipment with the sensorless Velineon motor. Ultra high-temperature Neodymium magnets, high-speed ball bearings, and a precision balanced rotor deliver power and long life with near zero maintenance. Since there are no brushes or commutator to wear out, you always get the same blistering acceleration and ballistic top speed run after run. \n \n \n \nLarger pinion gear/smaller spur gear combinations are for high-speed running on hard, smooth surfaces only. \n \n  \n \nPrecision 2.4GHz Control \n \nTraxxas Slash 4X4 OBA is equipped with the world's most advanced Ready-To-Race\u00c2\u00ae radio system. The all-new Traxxas\u00c2\u00ae TQi\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 arrives with a full complement of tuning features and offers the unbeatable convenience of \"no channels, no crystals\" 2.4GHz technology--but that's just the beginning. Automatic model recognition instantly recalls your settings for up to 30 Traxxas Link-enabled models. Just switch on and drive, no naming or \"model memory\" settings required. Power up the transmitter and the model you want to drive, and the settings for that model are dialed in immediately! The new TQi 2.4GHz transmitter is fully adjustable: steering and throttle end points can be set precisely, and the Multi-Function knob can be programmed to control Steering Sensitivity (Expo), Throttle Sensitivity (Expo), Steering Percentage (Dual Rate), Braking Percentage (Dual Rate), or Throttle Trim. TQi's ergonomic case design provides all-day driving comfort, and the unique internal antenna contributes to its sleek, modern look. \n \nEquipped with Low-CG Chassis \n \nSlash 4X4's performance refinements begin with Low-CG (low center of gravity) chassis that's unlike anything you've seen before. The battery and electronics are held as deep in the chassis as possible to position weight low in the chassis. Arrow-straight, hard-charging acceleration with Extreme Brushless Power and 4WD requires a chassis that won't flex under load. To offer the necessary rigidity, the chassis is reinforced by integrated ribs that form a triangulated structure optimized for the loads imparted by the suspension and powertrain. Underneath, the chassis is ultra-smooth to reduce drag and prevent snags whether you're blasting through whoops on the track or blazing trails in your backyard. The low-CG design dramatically increases corner speed and stability no matter where you drive. On the racecourse, Slash 4X4's low center of gravity allows high-output Velineon brushless power to be channeled into the track with superior traction, resulting in harder launches and faster lap times. \n \nAuthentic Short-Course Style \nSlash 4X4's Race Replica bodies are fully decorated with licensed logos and graphics for total authenticity. In addition to the no. Each truck is equipped with an accurate representation of the full-size tire, giving Slash 4X4 the ultimate in realistic performance and control. Wheels complete the look; offering equal parts style and strength, Slash 4X4 features a new SCT Split Spoke design and color-molded \"beadlock\" detail. Fully compatible with factory Traxxas and aftermarket tires, the wheels also feature 12mm hexes and the same offset as Slash 2WD rear wheels. \n \n100% Fully Assembled and Ready-To-Race\u00c2\u00ae \n \nSlash 4X4 comes fully-assembled and Ready-To-Race\u00c2\u00ae with the TQi 2.4GHz radio system installed and adjusted, Velineon brushless power system, a painted and decaled body, pre-glued tires, and detailed instructions.

{"title": "SONY HDR-XR550 Cam Corder Video Camera", "price": "475", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Via Linda & Frank Lloyd Wright", "description": "\n         \nExceptional Video Recorder.  SONY HRD-XR550 has 240Gb  oh on-board disk storage or 91 hours of HD video.  Ever since I've owned this I've never had to download and delete, it just never fills up! \nThe results from this camera when displayed on a wide screen via the HDMI cable are astounding. \nThe capture in dark evenings is fantastic as is the sound quality. \nI just don't seem to use it as much I should, kids grown up, so iPhone will do instead. \nExcellent condition, Complete with additional large capacity battery, charger (obvious), several cables including HDMI, manual and remote control.  Plus two tripods (one as in photo, the other a pocket one), plus cleaning kit. \nHere's a review from the web... \n \nSony always wants to go the extra mile and its latest Full HD shooter, complete with 240GB hard drive, has the capacity to put the 32GB and 64GB storage of rival cams well and truly in the shade. \nFavoring HDD (hard disk drive) over flash memory, the chunky and robust HDR-XR550 can store up to 101 hours of movies and stills. But it doesn't end there. Sony has opened up the XR550 to SD card recording as well as its traditional Memory Stick media, so insert an extra card of your choice and you'll increase recording potential still further. \nTouch sensitive \nBuilt for folks who are serious about their video, this cam uses a wide-angle G lens (26.3mm stills, 29.8mm video) that lets you cram loads more into a scene without the need to keep moving further away from your subject. It's perfect for landscape shots but works just as well for group shots. No one gets left out of the frame this time. \nThe pro-credentials are enhanced by the inclusion of a viewfinder and a superbly responsive 3.5in touchscreen LCD. You can use it to compose shots, browse the extensive but practical onscreen menu, and perhaps best of all review your footage on a screen that doesn't make you squint at what you're supposed to be watching. \nA manual focus and exposure ring to the side of the lens adds another level of user control over image taking, while an intuitive image stabilizer delivers something labelled as three-way shake cancelling -- which in plain speak means you get smoother shots no matter what end of the 10x optical zoom you're shooting at. \n \nLook at the second photo.  This is a copy of a current add from AMAZON; you'll see at the bottom it shows \"3 Used from $743.51\" \n \n$475 is a great deal. \nCall or text 602 432 78 seven eight or reply to add via email.

Go to Google or click here for a link to where I bought these from not even 1 1/2 years ago..... http://www.bigboystoysandhobbies.com/fg_rtr \n \n \nOK, so hopefully you researched how much these cost in the most simplest form THE R.T.R. version(plastic gearing,FM transmitter/receiver, nicd batteries,ect).. yeah after taxes and shipping they were both a little over $1800 WITHOUT any hope up's/alloy parts. In the pair to date with everything you really want and need while running a almost 30# vehicle with the most durability(alloy drivetrain,motor mounts, etc) i have over $4500 not quite $5k in the pair of trucks. So here's the deal, I own a landscape company and have more than a few guys that treat the tools I pay for worse than their own I hope, because i get a 'ooops' story almost every week. So I'm not saying I want all that $2k back, but please keep it relatable... I'm not trading my top tier RC for a used Toro backpack blower and some other bs brands. Because the way I see it, is my trucks over $2k new so whatever you're offering in trade needs to be relatively close to $2k worth when new also. Because no matter how shine your Toro still is for being used, my Truck's shiny'er ;) so here's the list of brands I'll ONLY trade for...  \n \nShawindawa,RedMax,Echo,Stihl, makita, Dewalt, jonsenred, dollar,etc.  \n \nEcho pb-770 or better blowers, no less than 18\" chainsaws, nice backpack sprayers, you get the hint.

It is in perfect condition and needs nothing at all. If you are not familiar with the Deuces, they were limited edition bikes designed by Willie G. Davidson himself. Some features of the Deuce are: more front end rake, longer, lower and stretched fuel tank, lower/longer seat, bigger rear tire (160/70-17,) polished aluminum rear wheel, 21\" spoke front tire, shorter rear fender, more chrome, and they were the first bikes to use the smaller bullet, tuck in turn signals. These bikes have a longer, lower, sleeker look than a normal Softail, a lower seat height, and better handling too.  It is powered by a fuel injected Twin Cam 88 engine, and it runs perfectly. This bike has Cobra dual exhaust with a crossover chamber, and a stage II  HP air cleaner for higher performance and better fuel mileage. It also has a Halogen headlight, and Flame style grips too. Since we love the Deuces and both of us have had several, we have other seats, (including a reduced reach touring seat), V&H Pro pipe, tach, and some other chrome goodies, available if you wish.

I have a 2006 Scion xA, I've owned it for just over 3 years and bought it completely stock but I've invested a lot of time, money and effort into it to make it a handling streetable car.  \nModifications include- \n- ksport kontrol pro coilovers/swift 200kg rear springs (ksport springs included) \n- hotchkis rear 24mm anti-sway bar \n- Megan racing H-brace  \n- DC Sports front strut bar \n- Megan racing rear c-pillar brace connected to a 1 off z \"cage\" \n- Minor weight reduction (approx. 100lbs) \n- FRS seats (just need to hook up seat connectors, still plan on doing so anyways) \n- Rear windshield wiper delete (virtually useless anyways) \n- StopTech Cryo-treated slotted rotors/ Hawk HPS Street compound pads \n- Energy Suspension front sway bar bushings \n-XXR 513 powder coated wrapped in Bridgestone Potenza Re760s sport tires \n(Note* wheels werent pretty when I bought them, used to be driven not to be pretty.) \n- TRD Glass Fog Lights w/ 3k bulbs (clean install) \n- lots of minor touches with LED lights (interior/exterior) \n- ZXE Headlight bulbs, much whiter and brighter than factory \n- DC Sports SRI \n- OBX-R 4-2-1 stainless header w/ heatshield mounts \n- New rear OEM bumper (unpainted) \n- New OEM wing spoiler (flint mica, not indigo pearl) it doesn't bother me they're not matching, planned on wrapping it in the future \n- UltraGauge OBDII data plug-in, real time vehicle data display  \n- Brand new Toyota Thermostat, seal, and coolant 3000 miles ago (routine maint. And was time for a flush) \nCons- \n- Automatic \n- Cracked front windshield \n- Hail damage \n- Salvage title because of ^^ \n- Trashed paint due to sun exposure \nAgain, the car wasn't meant to be the cleanest, it really was just a hold over car till I found something better, but I kinda fell with the idea that no body has one especially like this, its an interesting car for sure. It runs and drive absolutely perfect, never had a single problem with it ever. Oil changed every 3500 miles with mobile 1 advanced full synthetic 5w-30. Has 148,XXX miles, will go up slowly, I drive it once or twice a week. Blows cold A/C and hell temps heat. \nHave a full box of parts I've accumulated over the years, and the rear seats can go with, bit has a little bit of white paint on a part of it from a little mishap.

Excellent polo, or barrel horse prospect. Would excel in dressage and he's athletic enough to jump. He just needs someone to take him in the right direction.

He has such an icredivle mind and loves to work. He'll go all day long and never complain. He is still at the race track being used as a track pony. Has brand new shoes, health and coggins.

I'm just doing sprints now and don't need a Tri bike.  I'll just be riding my road bike.  I'm willing to sell it with its stock wheels with brand new tubes and brand new Michelin tires for $650 or with a set of Campagnolo Eurus light weight wheels with brand new Thick Slick tires and brand new tubes for $800.  The bike is a 10 speed Shimano Ultegra bike.  Campy wheelset has Shimano Ultegra 10 speed setup.  Bike has Profile Design bars and brand new red JagWire Pro shifter and brake cables, Brand new bar tape, brand new saddle mount two bottle cage, new number plate holder mounted in brake caliper hole on seat stay.  I purchased this bike a few months ago, spent tons of money getting it all set up to my liking and have decided to go a different route with my triathlon aspirations. Literally brand new cables, tires, tubes, cages, number plate bracket, bar tape and more.  I have a brand new, uninstalled Profile Design aero bottlet that mounts between the bars!  Never used.  I have the kit to mount it between wider bars, so there's tons of mounting options.  This was a $2500 bike when new and has been upgraded, maintained and tuned, so it's fresh and ready to go for its next owner.  Needs nothing but to be fitted to its new owner.  Tons of adjustability in these bikes!  I am 6'01\" and typically ride a 59-60cm road bike and bought this from a 5'9\"ish triathlete who would typically ride a 56cm road bike.  A lot more adjustment than a typical road bike.  The Aero carbon fiber seat post has tons of vertical adjustment and also has two configurations, allowing fore-aft adjustment of seat to change angle to bottom bracket.  For my asking price, I'll also throw in a brand new in sealed box (I could also install/set up the computer for you) Cateye Strada cycling computer!  The Fuji Aloha 1.0's were considerably more expensive than the Aloha 2.0's.  They had a nicer wheelset and upgraded components.

{"title": "M-Audio Profire 610 Audio Interface - Mint", "price": "140", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "7th Ave & Greenway Parkway", "description": "\n         \nSelling my M-Audio Profire 610 Audio Interface along with both the firewire cable and a firewire PCI card that I've used with it. \nIt's been well taken care of so it is not only in mint working condition but also still looks pretty much new. \nPrice is firm. Cash and local pickup only. \n \nProFire 610 \nDesigned by the company that revolutionized mobile music production, the ProFire\u2122 610 FireWire audio interface transforms your Mac or PC into a powerful 6-in/10-out recording studio. Premium digital converters deliver high-definition, 24-bit/192kHz audio throughout the signal path. Two preamps with award-winning Octane\u2122 technology offer clean, transparent sound with low noise and exceptional headroom. Onboard DSP mixing provides a totally flexible recording experience--perfect for creating multiple, independent monitor mixes. The user-assignable master volume knob gives you flexible control over output levels. MIDI I/O allows you to connect keyboards and other outboard MIDI hardware. The half-rack-space unit also doubles as a standalone two-channel microphone preamp and A/D-D/A converter. ProFire 610 is compatible with major audio software including Pro Tools*, Cubase, Logic, Sonar, Live and GarageBand, making it an unbeatable choice for personal, high-definition recording. \n \nContinuing the Legacy \nThe M-Audio\u00ae FireWire 410 audio interface helped ignite the mobile music revolution by delivering power and flexibility in a travel-friendly form factor. Musicians and producers tapped into a new level of creative freedom, using the FireWire 410 to make music in the field and on the go. ProFire 610 continues this legacy by introducing new features like Octane\u2122 preamp technology, DSP mixing and high-definition, 24-bit/192kHz audio quality. By combining these professional, studio-grade tools in a half-rack-space unit, ProFire 610 delivers the most powerful mobile recording experience. \nAward-winning Octane Preamp Technology \nGreat recordings start with great preamps. ProFire 610 brings you the same award-winning M-Audio Octane preamp technology that audio professionals trust for clean, transparent sound. Each preamp delivers low distortion and an extremely high signal-to-noise ratio--providing pristine audio fidelity right from the start of your signal path. In addition to exceptional sound, each preamp has a generous 73dB gain range**, 20dB pad and 48V phantom power. \n \nOnboard DSP Mixer \nProFire 610 features an onboard DSP mixer, giving you an extra level of flexibility and improving the overall performance of your system. Use the software control panel to create custom configurations for different recording setups, then save the settings and instantly recall them later. You can set up five unique stereo mixes sourced from any of the hardware inputs and software returns simultaneously--ideal for assigning separate monitor mixes to multiple musicians. The onboard DSP mixer also enables you to monitor while tracking, just as you would with a hardware mixer. \nHigh-Definition 192kHz Sound and Solid Performance \nM-Audio designed the ProFire 610 using carefully selected components, including premium A/D-D/A converters that keep your audio signal uncolored and true to any input source. We engineered the electronic circuitry to provide an optimal signal path between input and output, resulting in extremely clean recordings that capture every nuance of your performance. ProFire 610 also features critically acclaimed JetPLL jitter-elimination technology for stable synchronization and exceptionally low audio band jitter. Building on M-Audio's time-proven FireWire driver technology--found in the best-selling FireWire 410 interface--ProFire 610 delivers solid performance and reliability at sample rates up to 24-bit/192kHz. \n \nUser-Assignable Master Volume Control \nThe ProFire 610 interface delivers flexible control over output levels, allowing you to create a monitoring setup tailored to your specific needs. The master volume knob can be assigned to attenuate all output pairs simultaneously--ideal for controlling a 7.1 surround mix. Alternatively, the master volume knob can control the levels sent to your main monitors, while headphone outputs 1 and 2 operate independently. With four analog output pairs and an intuitive software control panel, ProFire 610 offers a wide range of options for unique monitoring scenarios. \nStandalone Operation \nProFire 610 also functions in standalone mode, allowing you to use its premium preamplifiers without connecting to a computer. Just power up ProFire 610, connect your microphones or instruments, and the preamp outputs automatically route to analog outputs 1 and 2, and S/PDIF. You can also connect digital devices via S/PDIF and convert to analog. This unique feature makes ProFire 610 ideal for both front-end preamplification and A/D-D/A conversion. \n \nBest-in-Class I/O \nProFire 610 features greater connectivity than any other interface in its class. Four unique analog inputs, eight analog outputs and stereo digital S/PDIF combine to form an impressive 6-in/10-out channel configuration. Easily access analog channels 1 and 2 via XLR/TS combo jacks on the front panel. Connect line-level instruments and effects processors to analog channels 3 and 4 via TRS. Use the eight 1/4\" TRS balanced line outputs and digital S/PDIF to monitor and interface with outboard gear. Connect keyboards and outboard MIDI hardware to the 1 x 1 MIDI interface. The two front-panel headphone jacks are sourced separately with independent level controls for additional cue mixing flexibility. ProFire 610 allows you to enjoy full 24-bit/192kHz operation on all inputs and outputs simultaneously. \n \nProfessional-Quality Design--To Go \nOnce upon a time, choosing a mobile recording interface meant sacrificing some of the features and quality found in big-budget studio equipment. Now ProFire 610 changes the game by delivering the same advanced technology and design elements found in our acclaimed ProFire 2626 recording interface. Harness the power of award-winning Octane preamp technology, DSP mixing and 24-bit/192kHz audio resolution in a bus-powered unit perfect for recording on the go. \n \nFeatures \n\u2022\tUp to 24-bit/192kHz for high-definition audio \n\u2022\tFlexible onboard DSP mixer \n\u2022\t2 preamps with award-winning M-Audio Octane\u2122 technology \no\tPhantom Power \no\t20dB pad on each preamp \no\tSignal/peak LED indicator lights \n \n\u2022\t6 inputs including: \no\t2 XLR/TS combo jacks for mics or instrument level inputs \no\t2 \u00bc\" TRS balanced line inputs \no\tStereo S/PDIF in \n \n\u2022\t10 outputs including: \no\t8 \u00bc\" TRS balanced line outs \no\tStereo S/PDIF out \n \n\u2022\t2 \u00bc\" TRS headphone outputs \n\u2022\tBuilt-in 1 x 1 MIDI interface \n\u2022\t2 FireWire (IEEE 1394) ports \n\u2022\tJetPLL jitter elimination technology \n\u2022\tStandalone operation as 2 mic pre/2-channel A/D-D/A converter \n\u2022\tUser-assignable master volume knob \n\u2022\tPowered via FireWire bus or external power supply \n\u2022\tHalf-rack-space form factor fits in Universal Rack Tray \n\u2022\tCompatible with major audio software including Pro Tools*, Cubase, Logic, Sonar, Live and GarageBand \nSpecifications \n\u2022\tLine Inputs (Balanced) \no\tFrequency Response: +/- 0.1dB, 20Hz to 22kHz, +/- 0.2dB, 20Hz to 80kHz (192kHz) \no\tSignal-to-Noise Ratio: -108dB (A-weighted) \no\tDynamic Range: 108dB (A-weighted) \no\tTHD+N: 0.002% (-94dB), 1kHz, -1dBFS \no\tCrosstalk: <-110dB @ 1kHz \no\tMaximum Input level: +16.1dBu, typical \no\tInput Impedance: >20k ohm, balanced \n \n\u2022\tMic Inputs (Balanced) At Min Gain, No Pad \no\tFrequency Response: +/- 0.2dB, 20Hz to 22kHz \no\tSignal-to-Noise Ratio (min gain, no pad): -108dB (A-weighted) \no\tDynamic Range (min gain, no pad): 108dB (A-weighted) \no\tTHD+N (min gain, no pad): 0.0022% (-93dB) @ -1dBFS, 1kHz \no\tCrosstalk: < -110dB @ 1kHz \no\tMaximum Input level: from +28dBu @ min gain, pad on to -45dBu @ maxgain, no pad \no\tInput Impedance: 3.7k ohms, balanced, no pad \no\tAdjustable Gain: >53dB without pad \no\tPad: -20dB \n \n\u2022\tInst.

{"title": "Custom gaming, super price", "price": "650", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "3536 W Elm St, Phoenix, AZ", "description": "\n         \nLAST WEEK!!  - Keep in mind you're getting a $300+ new video card, a FAST $185 cpu and a great motherboard at $135 all of which have virtually no use.  PLUS the RAM, CASE, FANS, HARD DRIVE, and WIN 7 PRO all unused until now. THAT'S over $1k in parts/software that we'll donate for the tax break.  Either way it's gone by Friday, Jan 20.  The price is not negotiable.  I have about 12 computers that I need to move to make space for new builds (I can barely walk around the test bench!!) This is the first one I've used Craigslist for (usually Amazon) because we're more than taking a hit on every one of these.  READ the specs, compare oranges to oranges ( I DON\"T do \"Apple\" anything :-)  )  I won't answer questions about specs except to compare.  I've been building over 30 years now and STILL learn something new daily!  This is the best \"entry\" level gamer with Intel that's out there. \nIntel i5 4460 - 16GB 1600Ghz G. Skill Ram (9-9-9-24) - Asus Z97-A motherboard - EVGA GTX 970 video card (new, right out of the box) - LG DVD R/W drive - 1 Tb Western Digital Blue 7200 rpm HDD - 6 120mm fans (but it's extremely quiet), 3 are red LED - Windows 7 Pro installed - all video drivers installed -  \n   This is built for gamers, which means it WILL do everything else, too.  It's also built for expansion, like all my machines for clients.  The board will take any Intel Core processor up to i7 4790K. The MOUSE, KEYBOARD and MONITOR are NOT included, as those are personal preference. If you use WiFi you need an adapter. I will support any issues you come across.  If you break it I'll fix it for you, you paying my cost only.  If we caused an issue we'll fix it at no cost.  But seriously, it's been bench tested and burned in long enough that I wouldn't turn it loose not knowing it was great.  I'll take cash, check or credit card with I.D., make sure you see it running, and let you go feeling comfortable with buying it.  I'll check my email at least 2x daily as the builds/rebuilds allow.  If you don't like this one, keep an eye out...there are more coming, big and small!  And if you're a student at Grand Canyon University carrying your student i.d., then I'll take 15% off...it's my alma mater, too. \n     Any doubters?  Last photo is mine, BigBlue, just a few minutes after posting 24th in the world rankings on Catzilla out of 4k+ entries, and done without liquid nitrogen or helium! Kevin, NoJ\u00f6kComputers.

So I  haven't had a need to put them  on right away due to my schedule and time. \n* Leaks  a little bit  of oil. Still runs  fine, sounds fine, pulls great, but  does leak a little oil. Nothing major. \n* Rear tail light not working and center counsel speedometer not working since its all electrical (I only ride during the day) \n \nThis is a great price for  an  amazing bike.

{"title": "Wren and Cuff Pickle Pie B CME w/Mod Fuzz Distortion", "price": "180", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": null, "description": "\n         \nBrand new in box Wren and Cuff Pickle Pie B CME w/Mod Fuzz Distortion Pedal for guitar or bass. Boutique ish pedal based on a way huge swollen pickle. \n \n \n \nWhat is the mod? We call this the \"Deep Mod\". \n \nThe Pickle Pie B was made with a very subtle mid \"scoop\" in order to let the bass punch through the mix. This is one of the characteristics that differentiates the Pickle Pie B from other muffs. . . More mids! Just for fun, when making the special edition Pickle for Chicago Music, we added a toggle switch that allows you to drop the mid-scoop into a more traditional vintage-style range. One setting is the stock Pickle B, hit the switch, and the notch in the mid-range gets deeper. \n \nThis simply makes an incredibly versatile pedal, even more versatile. \n \nPro Tip: Try the Pickle on regular guitar (especially with the Deep-Mod). With a subtle amount of clean tone mixed in, you'll get the creamy muff sound, with the presence and pick-attack of the unaffected guitar. Great for leads! \n \n \nFor a long time now I'd been planning on making a fuzz pedal designed for the many distortion loving bass players out there. It all started when I began getting a large percentage of my Pickle Pie sales from bass players who knew The Pickle's reputation as a \"guitar\" pedal that could handle the low frequencies of the bass, and give a nice spongy fuzz much better than most of the Muff family. \n \nEven though most were happy with this pedal, I had always wanted to take a stab at doing some tweaks to The Pickle to create a pedal with a much different voice, but one that still uses the same basic skeleton as the PP, and strives to resolve many of the common quandaries bassists come across in their search for a fuzz that really works for their instrument and their playing situation. Long story short, I spent much of my spare time for a few months trying many, many different ideas and experiments till I came up with something I was really happy with. \n \n \nA FET buffered active clean-boost. \n \nNo \"drop out\" when you kick on the fuzz when playing live. Helps give the feel of running two amps, one wet, one dry for those of us who can't afford two SVT's, and/or can't lug two bass amps down to the local club. \n \nTotally changed FET-hybrid clip sections. \n \nAlong with great sounding fuzz, this specific clipping combo helps the fuzz to mesh with the clean signal in a natural way, instead of just sitting on top of the dry signal like some fuzzers with clean blends can do. \n \nAltered tone-stack range geared specifically for bass. \n \nA widened range of usable tones from the \"shape\" knob. The pedal overall has a much less pronounced mid-scoop which helps it to retain presence in a live playing situation. \n \nAltered saturation (fuzz) knob to make it highly usable at lower gain settings. \n \nRoll the fuzz back, and things still sound crisp, also tighter lows at high fuzz settings. I know everyone says this, but The PP \"B\" really can go from a dirty, gritty, slightly over-driven clean-blended bass sound, to fully saturated, watch out for feedback, drop-C meltdown, and everything in-between. \n \nVarious cap and resistor changes. \n \nSeveral core changes to the circuit to even better accommodate the bass guitar.

Minor mechanical problems but still running great. $1,250 obo. \nKBB: https://www.kbb.com/toyota/camry/1999/ce-sedan-4d/?vehicleid=6048&intent=trade-in-sell&mileage=241000&pricetype=private-party&condition=fair \n \nInterior is well maintained as you can see from the pictures. Oil changes have been kept up to date the entire life of the car (it's been a hand-me-down in my family since it was bought new). \n \nI'm being totally upfront with all of the issues with the car so you know exactly what you're getting. \n \nThere is an oil leak somewhere down under the timing belt. I've had two separate mechanics tell me there's a gasket leaking somewhere under there that is a cheap fix but the labor to get to it would be too expensive for what the car is worth. If you can do the labor yourself or know someone who can do it cheap it will be a cheap fix for a car that's still running great. Over the past few weeks I've just been putting oil in it every couple times I drive and the leak is slow enough that the level stays good. \n \nThe speed sensor will throw a check engine code occasionally when it's really hot during these AZ summers. Right after starting up if you don't let it run for a bit and take off driving the engine will rev a little high (just enough to throw the code) and then drive perfectly fine. The check engine light goes out on it's own after driving it a couple more times. Not a problem right now but you'll probably run into it over the summer. I always had o'reilly's or similar store do a check engine code pull (for free) to make sure it was the speed sensor and not something else. \n \nThere's some damage to the driver's side front on the light (see picture) but the lights still work just fine. \n \nPaint is suffering from peeling because of the crazy arizona sun (see pic). \n \nTo the best of my knowledge this is everything wrong with the car. \n \n \nNow on to what I've had done recently with the car. \n \nAbout 3 years ago there was a new transmission put in. \nAbout 2 years ago I had a new radiator put in, as well as new brakes, timing belt, water pump, and all seals under the timing belt. I also had new tires put on that have warranty with them through Big'O'Tire so if they go flat or have any damage you pay a pro-rated fee for replacement (they're a little under halfway through the tread). \n \nWithin the last two years there haven't been many mechanical problems with the car other than the more recently developed oil leak. If I knew how to fix it myself I'd be keeping it. \n \nAsking 1,250 obo because the car is still running great but will need a bit of mechanical work. This is a great commuter car!

Only selling because I'm looking for something different. I bought this brand new at GoAZ Scottsdale a year and a half ago. Currently has 4,332 miles on it and I've averaged 40 MPG. I keep it in a garage at home, under covered parking when I (occasionally) take it to work. Bike has the package with quick shifter (no clutch needed for upshifts) and factory cruise control and heated grips. Multiple riding modes: Rain, Road, Dynamic, Dynamic Pro. Electronic suspension: Soft, Normal, Hard, also can specify single or two riders for each suspension setting.  \n \nThis bike is spotless, I wipe it off after every ride. Oil changed at dealer for 1st service and changed one time after that as well. I have the documentation to go with that. Only modification is a nice radiator guard to protect the radiator and oil cooler. I just took new pictures today Jan 2, 2017 2:15 PM. \n \nThis bike was over $17k (after tax, title, fees) at the dealer, no tax when buying private party! \n \nPlease only serious offers. I do have a lein on it though BMW Financial so we can meet at your bank to get it paid off and transferred to your name. I will not take payments, and I do not need help selling. \n \nThanks, \nMike \n \nkeywords: VFR zx zx10 zx10r zx-10 zx-10r Sport bike RC 30 Superhawk fz1 fz6 monster ducati 696 1098 bandit triumph street triple speed daytona 919 z1000 fighter cbr r6 gsxr gsx 600 1000 zx6r ninja 650 sf street fighter 990 cb1000r z1000 b-king CBR R6 R1 ZX6 CBR600 CBR1000 Hayabusa ZRX ZRX1200 1100 CB YZ KZ Honda Suzuki Kawasaki Yamaha Streetbike Monster RC51 RC-51 BMW S 1000 R RR    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_1oLAmFLb2fq_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_9eLdfwtfDEL_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_TMXJECT5bc_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01010_dUAz6dGem63_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01616_gvnWelRpxwG_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_ZP9k4P6WHw_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00303_fDdRS4W1nSY_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_e2bQSMzYrkO_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00909_2KOt3PeQRl4_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_dSRGKwgGADv_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00W0W_eaHqpMXBZOF_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_hesJxI2clcr_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00B0B_l7YGuZ0zniR_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "33.596719", "lng": "-111.879187", "postId": "5937366165", "postingUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/nph/mcy/5937366165.html", "postDate": "2016-12-29T09:49:21-0700", "updateDate": "2017-01-11T19:48:49-0700", "attributes": "2015 BMW S1000R like new gas 4332 blue lien manual", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/mcy/5937366165", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:08:24.761135", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

Soon after I got it though I was able to buy a few guitar pedals for myself. I am a medical student and need the money. Since I have my pedals, I figured I would sell this since I have not used it and do not see myself using it. \n \nIt is amazing what you get in this little box. It can be used to play live and can be used for practicing any place that you are, great for recording etc and so ridiculously portable. The tones on it are actually amazing plus you can edit them to fit whatever sound you want. You can also download other people's preset tones based on artist or style. Lastly you can edit everything on the go or on your computer, which ever one you want. \n \nThank you. \n \nPS: Here is the description from the line 6 website. \nPocket POD\u00ae exhibits all the celebrated features and pro tone that makes POD a standard in recording studios everywhere. Don't be fooled by the smaller package, Pocket POD is packed with over 300 custom presets dialed in by some of today's hottest rock stars like Maroon 5, P.O.D., 311, Hoobastank and many more. Battery-powered and about the size of a tuner, Pocket POD is completely portable. Use it for effects in front of your amp, or just plug in headphones and practice anywhere, anytime. Connect to any computer via USB, then download the free Vyzex software and \"deep dive\" into all your tone details to create your own custom tone, or manage your own personal tone library right on your desktop. Or visit CustomTone.com to download any of the 3,000 free presets created by guitarists from around the world. Pocket POD lets you sound like a rock star wherever you go.

We are looking to get rid of everything and quickly. Do note that I will turn down low offers as I would rather donate the stuff for a tax break:  \n \nIf the item is still listed here it is still available: \n \n60\" SANYO HDTV - SOLD \nComes with wall mount and all necessary cables. TV looks great and works like new. Please note that I do not have the original TV stand or remote. This TV is wall mountable only and you can program any remote to work with it. (DIRECTV or a $5 universal remote from Walmart) TV will be plugged in and ready for you to test out before buying.  \n \nBrown leather couch and love seat. Sold as a pair. The couch has 2 built in recliners. Super comfortable. Dudes, this couch is quality but with quality comes weight. I paid $1400 for it 1 year ago. We put some tears into it trying to get it up the stairs into the apartment. We patched most of it up. Long story short, I'll give you the deal of your life on this couch but you have to pick it up and I'm not helping you carry it.  \n \n(SOLD) \nWooden high top table and 8 chairs. The table has a leaf that comes out to make it a 4 seater.  We loved the set up. We'd be happy to throw in the place matts and napkins if you're interested. A few chairs have been patched. Barely noticeable. \n \n(Sold) \nPS4 with 2 controllers. Works great. No issues or major scratches. One controller is brand new one has a triangle button that is a bit sticky. Annoying like no other tbh. I'll only charge you for the one.  \n \n(SOLD) \n2 large framed photos from IKEA. We paid $50 each not even 6 months ago. Make me an offer.   \n \nCoffee table and 2 end tables plus a shelf all from IKEA. All matching super dark brown ... basically black. Ya black... idk \n \n \nWe also have 4 standing lamps. All work great and look good. How about $20 each.  \n \nWe have a off white area rug. It's a year old and lost its super white color. It can easily be saved though with a carpet clean. Paid $70... how about $10.  \n \nVisio Surround sound and sound bar. Cabled, not wireless. Sound bar works great but one of the small speakers blew. Honestly the sub woofer and sound bar is more than enough to feel like you're at a movie theater.  \n \nWe have a California king sized bed with black frame and headboard. The bed is 1 year old and has had one owner. Pet free and smoke free environment. \n \n(SOLD) \nWe have matching nightstands for the bed as well. One for each side.  \n \nWe have Frisbee Golf discs. 2 full sets. Make an offer.  \n \n(SOLD) \nWe have a Primo water fountain. Instant hot and cold. Does not increase energy costs by much.

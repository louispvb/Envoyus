With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago.

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

CALL / TEXT: 65O-TWO-9O-TWO-397  TOP CASH PAID Hayden Separator Antique Shop A Very Merry CHRISTMAS to You All! 2nd Annual Christmas Present Special With each purchase over $50.00-$99.99 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in red paper. With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you.

A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

CALL / TEXT: 65O-TWO-9O-TWO-397  TOP CASH PAID\n\n\n Hayden Separator Antique Shop A Very Merry CHRISTMAS to You All! 2nd Annual Christmas Present Special With each purchase over $50.00-$99.99 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in red paper. With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you. A very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all of you!\n\n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5957304130", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/wad/5957304130.html", "postDate": "2017-01-13T04:25:27-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "low", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5957304130", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:48:14.326336", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you.

Color illustrations based on oil and water color paintings of living specimens by Charles Hudson, A. H. Baldwin, and Kako Morita. Color lithography by Julius Bien and Co., NY.

This single-sided plate with no text on the verso, printed on a very interesting heavier paper which measures approximately 10 1/2\" wide and 7 1/2\" high.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you.

Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W. ANY OF MY NEWSPAPERS OR MAGAZINES may be inspected (AT THE COUNTER) after you pay for them.

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you.

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

Add the lovely, real wood veneer that graces Polk's RTi series, and you've got yourself great sound that looks gorgeous in your room. \n \nHere's how: with a 1\" silk/polymer dome tweeter, the RTi70 delivers stellar treble extension, with clear, detailed response. Mids and lows are full and satisfying, thanks to twin 6-1/2\" Dynamic Balance\u00c2\u00ae drivers -- and Polk's unique Power Port\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 technology makes for bass that you can feel as well as hear. Innovative features, like a raised bezel and anti-diffraction grille, result in a large, open, three-dimensional soundstage with pinpoint-accurate stereo imaging; because the grille frame mounts flush to the bezel, unwanted grille diffraction is minimized. The audio is smooth, clean, and stunning. And with a beautiful wood veneer available in black or cherry finish, these slim towers will take your breath away. \n \nOther details include two sets of gold-plated 5-way binding posts for biamping or biwiring, and adjustable spikes for carpeted or hardwood floors. \n \nRecommended center channel speaker: CSi40. \nRecommended surround speakers: RTi38 or FXi50. \n \nDetails: \n \nvideo-shielded \nbass-reflex design \nfrequency response 40-26,000 Hz (-3dB) \n8-ohm impedance \nsensitivity 90 dB \nhandles up to 250 watts \nreal wood veneer \n9\"W x 41-1/4\"H x 12-1/4\"D \n \nMSRP : $449.00 \n \nReceiver: \n \nYamaha RX-V673 7.2-Channel Network AV Receiver  \n \nKey Features \n \nNetwork receiver with AV Controller App for iPad/iPhone/iPod and Android phones/tablets \n7.2-Channel Powerful Surround Sound with 105W per Channel \nApple Airplay Allows Streaming Music to AV Receiver \nHD Audio format decoding: Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio; Dolby Digital Plus and DTS-HD High Resolution Audio \n4K pass-through for next generation super high resolution displays, and HDMI (4 in/1 out) with 3D and Audio Return Channel \nFront panel USB Digital Connection for iPad/iPod/iPhone & MP3 \nYPAO sound optimization for automatic speaker setup in minutes \nAssignable amplifiers for bi-amp connection or Zone B for extended audio in another room \nECO mode operation for about 20%* less power consumption \n \nMSRP: $599    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_f5CVs5CIZVv_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_iQVZMMIII7H_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01717_ceGcuELjifC_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01414_3UnM5hNkTQb_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00W0W_jbsp8HWXCNG_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01616_dbfFLPUTXlY_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.812600", "lng": "-122.244300", "postId": "5946112912", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/ele/5946112912.html", "postDate": "2017-01-04T21:24:47-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-11T20:46:18-0800", "attributes": "like new Polk Audio RTi70", "locAccuracy": "highest", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/ele/5946112912", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:49:11.988885", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

It then heats up automatically until it reaches the default set basic temperature of 356\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). With a double-click on the button, you activate the booster temperature of 383\u00b0F (195\u00b0C). When the set vaporization temperature is reached, it is signaled through a short double-vibration and the LED-indicator lamp: The LED changes the color from red to green. \n \n    Full Convection Hot Air \n    Precise electronic control \n    Single Lithium Ion Battery Power \n    High Efficiency Heat Exchanger \n    Super Precise Temperature Control \n    Wireless Bluetooth Multifunction App \n    Automatic switch off \n \n  \n \nWith the CRAFTY, as well as with the MIGHTY and PLENTY, vaporization functions on the basis of a full hot air convection heating combined with conduction. The convection heating provides an immediate and continuous vaporization, whereas the conduction ensures that there is vapor created from the very first breath. \n \nThe Filling Chamber, which is integrated into the Vaporizer, is to be filled with plant material (this is facilitated by the included Filling Aid) and the Cooling Unit with Mouthpiece is to be attached. The Cooling Unit makes sure that the vapor cools down and guarantees optimal flavor and a rich aroma. \n \nThe CRAFTY is the smallest STORZ & BICKEL Vaporizer with a size of 4.3 x 2.2 x 1.3 inches (11.0 x 5.7 x 3.3 cm) and a weight of 0.3 lbs (135 g). \nCRAFTY REMOTE CONTROL APP - Individual settings of your CRAFTY through Bluetooth Low Energy \n \nThe free CRAFTY Remote Control App offers you the opportunity to set basic and booster temperature of your device according to your personal preferences. Amongst other things, the App allows you to read off the battery charge status on your smartphone, to turn on and off the vibration function of the CRAFTY and to activate an alarm and vibration function for your smartphone. \n \nYou can download the CRAFTY Remote Control App for free from the Apple App Store (for iPhone 4s or higher) or from the Google Play Store (for Android 4.3 or higher with blue tooth low energy fully enabled). Simply scan the QR Code with your iPhone and you will be forwarded directly to your App Store. \n \n \n \n \n keys: oil concentrate shatter glass amber e-juice ejuice e-juices ejuices glass globe dome bong pipe waterpipe tobacco nicotine marijuana bud cannabis weed waxes oils concentrates top attachment tops tanks tank tip battery batteries smoke-free smoke free vapor vapors atmos arizier thermovape cloud g-pen omicron volcano da buddha flight box uptoke ego vap vape vapes vaporizer vaporizers pax vapir vaped micro vaped microvaped white rhino vaporall platinum vapes vaper trippy stix trippy stixs trippystix stick sticks pen pens e-cig e-cigs e-cigarette e-cigartettes e-cigar cloud blower ecig ecigarette ecigs dab bho wax liquid juice juices liquids flavor flavors flavored hooka hookah.

{"title": "2009 Mercedes Benz AMG SL63", "price": "45000", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "menlo park", "description": "\n         \nI am selling my heavily optioned 2009 Mercedes-Benz SL63 produced by AMG in Affalterbach, Germany. I bought the vehicle in March 2014 with 27,000 miles, it currently has 33,500 miles on the odometer.  \n \nThis car is in excellent condition -- always garaged and always protected with a car cover when parked outdoors. This is a weekend cruising car perfect for trips down Pacific Coast highway or a top-down jaunt through the city. The V8 engine has immense torque and a low, guttural growl that isn't too aggressive- together with the upgraded suspension package and wider tires makes for exciting highway on-ramps and runs down Skyline Drive.  \n \nThis SL63 has never been in an accident and does not need any maintenance.  \nStandard SL63 options include: \n- Hand-built 6.3L V8 engine producing 518 horsepower/465 lb-ft torque (car came from the factory with a DVD of its engine being built) \n- 7 speed dual clutch manumatic transmission (0.100 sec shifts in manual control mode) with paddle shifters and three driving modes \n-14.2 inch 6-piston ventilated front brakes and 13.0 inch 4-piston ventilated rear brakes \n- AMG Sport Exhaust \n- 19\" Wheels with 255/35 front and 285/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport Pro tires \n- Automatic retracting hardtop that works flawlessly- no binding, hesitation, or issues. No repairs ever needed to this mechanism. \n- 12-way adjustable heated, massaging seats with memory (perfect condition -- no scratches, scuffs, or wear present) \n- Alcantara headliner (in perfect condition) \n- 6-disc stereo-navigation system with 40GB hard drive, Bluetooth connectivity, and voice command. Harmon-Kardon speakers still in perfect condition -- no fading drivers. Sirius satellite radio compatible -- though I never used it.  \n- iPhone/mobile audio connection in center console (works with iPhones 4, 5, and 6) -- includes stereo jack for any other portable audio device.  \n \nOriginal MSRP was $159,675, including $21,200 in additive options: \n- Option 219 -- Parktronic: Sensor-assist front and rear collisions detection \n- Option 220 - Distronic: Adaptive Cruise Control  \n- Option 033 - Designo interior in Mocha Black (pearlescent medium brown highlights that show up really well in bright sunlight) \n- Option 217 - Red AMG Premium Leather \n- Option H73 - Carbon Fiber trim package (interior and exterior carbon elements) \n- Option 030 - AMG Performance Package including: 19\" AMG forged alloy wheels, AMG Limited Slip Differential (LSD), Track-calibrated Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system, AMG performance steering wheel (hollow alloy spokes and flat bottom), increased governing speed to 186mph \n- Suspension lifts to clear obstacles and steep grades in the road \n- Suspension has Comfort (suppresses rough road conditions) and Sport (aggressively enhances handling capability) driving modes which are really significant, unlike many German sports cars where these modes only make minor changes.  \n- Option P01 - Premium Package, consisting of: activated ventilated (heated and cooled) seats, electronic trunk closer, Airscarf (heated headrest blower), and Keyless Go (push-button start and keyless entry) \n \nThe engine is in mint condition. I never experienced any hesitation or detonation; it doesn't burn any oil or knock on startup. The motor pulls strong through the rev range. Transmission shifts rapidly every time. I have not had a single repair needed since I purchased the vehicle. I never saw any DTC records appear (check engine light).   \n \nInterior is in mint condition. All electronic systems work perfectly and I know it connects with iPhone generations 4, 5 and 6.  \n \nExterior is in excellent condition -- there is one minor blemish on the front fender that was present when I bought it in March of 2014. Paint is in excellent condition -- I wax and clay block it regularly.

Will trade for a nice, must be running, old truck. 50's, 60's, maybe 70's up to '72 only. Will consider Fords also. Local trade only. As close to an original condition pickup as possible. Please make sure you send photos of your trade. I've seen some that have been lowered. I like that look also. Prefer Chevy, V8, Auto trans, but email me what you would be willing to part with.....No junk.....please look at the photos.......the bike is very nice......It's also almost 16 years old. Registered to June of 2017. All maintenance services performed on time or early, always. Lives under a cover, inside, always. Was bone stock when I bought in '09. I have added quite a bit of chrome. But tastefully. It's not overdone. Fork lock cover has a nice September eleventh 2001 Twin Tower emblem.  Added performance items are Vance and Hines True Dual exhaust headers, with chrome heat shields. The slip on mufflers are Bub 7. Beautiful sound, not too loud. Harley stage one for the fuel injection, and the map was changed in the ECM at the Harley Dealer to match the exhaust and the Stage 1 fuel injection kit. Kuryakyn Sound of Chrome powered speakers were added, in addition to a Harley Davidson holder for your Iphone, Ipod, Walkman, etc. Those are mounted to the newer \"Heritage\" handlebars which are closer to the rider for comfort. Still have the stock Roadking handlebars. Also has the big matching \"tour pack\" which serves as rear storage and a backrest for your passenger. In addition to that, the bike has another passenger backrest, and chrome rear rack if you want to travel lighter. Everything is quick detachable.  Bike is extremely road worthy, and a pleasure to ride. Every stock item I have taken off of the bike, I still have. I have done some troop escorts with the bike. I can include the fancy flag holder if you are interested in that. Also very easily added or removed when needed. If I don't like what you are offering you will not hear from me. Thank you for looking.

{"title": "1997 Honda Civic LX - smogged, registered, clean title, gasket leak", "price": "1100", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "oakland east", "description": "\n         \nHi, I'm selling my 1997 Honda Civic LX. It starts and runs great. It has a clean title, clean carfax report, it is smogged, is currently registered, and has meticulously kept car mechanic records for its ENTIRE HISTORY. \n \nJust a few months ago, we took it to a mechanic and put several thousands dollars worth of work into this car because we were planning to drive it for the next 10 years. \n \nIt has: \n \n1. New tires \n2. New radiator \n3. A new radiator overflow tank \n4. New thermostat \n5. New hoses \n6. New distributer cap and rotor \n7. New spark plugs \n8. New exhaust manifold \n9. New catalytic converter \n10. New drive axel \n11. New timing belt (<10,000 miles on it) \n12. All new drive belts \n \nThe exterior is in fair shape - it has some dents and dings and peeling paint. \n \nThe interior is in fair/good shape. There are some stains as you can see in the picture. \n \nEverything works - AC, cruise control, nice aftermarket stereo with iphone charger & cd player, all automated windows work with the exception of one back window. \n \nHere's the bad news: \n \nAfter my boyfriend had the radiator overflow replaced, there were air pockets in the radiator. After driving on the highway, the engine overheated. It was not safe to immediately pull over, so it took a couple of minutes before he turned off the car. When we took it to the mechanic's, and they diagnosed a small leak in the head gasket. The leak is currently very small and almost unnoticeable but it's there. We parked the car IMMEDIATELY (within 30 miles of it being diagnosed) with the goal of eventually rebuilding our engine.  \n \nHowever, realistically, we're busy and could use the money for other higher priority projects. Our loss is your gain.  \n \nIf you're handy and interested in purchasing, email or text us. I screen my phone calls so just text me to get an answer.  \n \nThe price is firm. Please bring cash in hand. Serious inquiries only please. \n \nThanks in advance, \n-Tara    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_gYaivLoCpK7_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00909_iq8BOlyFToG_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_iyyYj9Rk7N7_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_fHrhi6MjNkf_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_25WCBKx6sQ7_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_8llyDPVTOJo_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00R0R_jOhyi7eZN5a_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_jGF204CjZNV_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00b0b_7GGppB8w0HZ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00S0S_9QCCzNv0l6B_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_jRnB4eAWlp3_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00606_4b50k62xQxc_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00909_5BfHvw9iNyZ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_5ZoSJ7mL3mt_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00202_b18vPAlss9w_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.777228", "lng": "-122.219279", "postId": "5936006520", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/cto/5936006520.html", "postDate": "2016-12-28T09:14:07-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "1997 Honda Civic LX 2HGEJ6674VH527361 fair 4 cylinders fwd gas 190000 green compact clean automatic", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/cto/5936006520", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:49:32.092442", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "Roland Jupiter-80 Synthesizer, like new, in custom road case on wheels", "price": "2499", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "san mateo", "description": "\n         \nTHE best synth for performing musician ever produced, period, top choice of A-list acts. 256-note polyphony, layering, effects, arpeggiator. Zillion of ready-made sounds from Roland's acclaimed SuperNatural library, including recreation of signature patches from legends of the past -- Jupiter-6 and -8, Juno-60 and -106, JX-series, D-50, SH-101, TB-303 and many others. Every sound you can possibly think of is here, built-in, instantly accessible. No need to dig deep in menu layers, browse through banks and cards, everything is right on the surface! \n \nJupiter-80 is extremely powerful synth, more than anything else on the market, but also very user-friendly, unlike Korg Kronos, Nord and many others. Quick access buttons let you recall favorite sounds quickly, while touch screen makes editing a breeze. Everything is designed with live performers in mind, with quick and easy access. You can layer and split over keyboard no less than 10 (ten!) parts (individual sounds). This way you can play, for example bassline and pads, or pads and solos, or create unique layered combinations. Possibilities are really endless, limited only by your imagination! \n \nOne unique feature of JP-80 is registration buttons. Located right below the keyboard, it lets you store and instantly recall 256 performance memories (any combination of sounds), by pressing two buttons at most! A life-saver during live performance, when every second counts: you press those with your thumb, no need to even take hands off the keyboard! No other synth on the market has these! \n \nAnother handy feature is USB player/recorder. You can record your performance as 2-track stereo, or, if you are using backing tracks, play them straight from USB, with separate level and 4-band EQ controls. Similar to a digital mixer, except all this is done inside JP-80, nothing else is needed. Recording can be done in any format, up to .WAV at 96K, so you can import your performance straight into any DAW, Pro Tools, Logic, whatever, like it was a soft synth. It also has stereo line input at the back, handy for playing backing track or break music straight from iPhone. Also convenient when learning covers: you can hear the original and play along, no other equipment is needed. \n \nToo many features to even list here. Read more online and watch videos on YouTube, there are plenty. Here are some: \nFull features demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afS_wDWDnbU \nJonathan Cain (JOURNEY) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JlMv3F7zLc \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyKf1Ixublg \nSynth legends demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkSST5032g \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=229Stlmb86I \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92gkfGRTafU \n \nSynth is in new condition, not even a single scratch anywhere. Works flawlessly, 100%. Firmware was updated to the most recent v.2.11, with all \"Classic Collection\" sounds from the legends of the past: Jupiter-8, Juno-106, JP-8000, and even some brass, piano and bass sounds from another classic: Yamaha DX-7! Was stored in custom-ordered road case from day one, used in studio only, never taken out on the road. The case alone is worth at least $400, also brand new. Also included is a custom soft cover by DigitalDeskCovers. \n \nLocated in San Mateo, you can come and test it any way you want. Available most days until 7pm. \n \nSince you see this ad now, it means that synth is STILL AVAILABLE.

Heated, cooled and advertised all under one business, Blue Moon. Most Unique Gifts for Dad or Grand Dads......... I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

CALL / TEXT: 65O-TWO-9O-TWO-397  TOP CASH PAID Hayden Separator Antique Shop A Very Merry CHRISTMAS to You All! 2nd Annual Christmas Present Special With each purchase over $50.00-$99.99 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in red paper. With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms.

CALL / TEXT: 65O-TWO-9O-TWO-397  TOP CASH PAID\n > Hayden Separator Antique Shop A Very Merry CHRISTMAS to You All! 2nd Annual Christmas Present Special With each purchase over $50.00-$99.99 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in red paper. With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you. A very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all of you! \n\n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5954513677", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/wad/5954513677.html", "postDate": "2017-01-11T05:38:11-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "low", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5954513677", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:50:22.094618", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you.

If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you.

These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services.

Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

Heated, cooled and advertised all under one business, Blue Moon. Most Unique Gifts for Dad or Grand Dads......... I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history.

(meaning this was purchased less than 1 month ago)  \nIncludes:  \n-Original Box \n-Brand new, unused cable \n-Brand new, unused headset \n-Brand new, used charger block \n \nThis phone is not stolen or found. The phone is not icloud blocked or blacklisted, I just don't want it. The photos will do justice on how good of a condition this phone is in. This phone is selling for $869 + Tax at apple, meaning it's going to be about $950 brand new. Save yourself $150 bucks. \n \nPlease no low ballers or scammers.

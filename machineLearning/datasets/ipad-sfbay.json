With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business.

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms.

Heated, cooled and advertised all under one business, Blue Moon. Most Unique Gifts for Dad or Grand Dads......... I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W. ANY OF MY NEWSPAPERS OR MAGAZINES may be inspected (AT THE COUNTER) after you pay for them. You will clearly see they are complete and authentic\n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5957342811", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/wad/5957342811.html", "postDate": "2017-01-13T05:22:12-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "low", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5957342811", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:50:44.332404", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you.

A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you.

Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services.

Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you. A very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all of you! \n\n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5954513677", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/wad/5954513677.html", "postDate": "2017-01-11T05:38:11-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "low", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5954513677", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:50:57.154467", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

CALL / TEXT: 65O-TWO-9O-TWO-397  TOP CASH PAID Hayden Separator Antique Shop A Very Merry CHRISTMAS to You All! 2nd Annual Christmas Present Special With each purchase over $50.00-$99.99 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in red paper. With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms.

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

Heated, cooled and advertised all under one business, Blue Moon. Most Unique Gifts for Dad or Grand Dads......... I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W. ANY OF MY NEWSPAPERS OR MAGAZINES may be inspected (AT THE COUNTER) after you pay for them.

{"title": "New YAMAHA TF1 32 channel digital mixer", "price": "1799", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "san mateo", "description": "\n         \nTF1 is the easiest digital mixer to work on, even untrained church volunteers can mix on it after brief introduction! 36 inputs to mix, 20 onboard inputs, 16 onboard mic preamps (same recallable preamps as in QL/CL series), 16 outputs (freely assignable as mains, subgroups, monitor mixes, etc.).  \n \nMixer is NEW,  was bought it for a church project who decided to go with the larger Yamaha QL5  (a $12K desk) at the last moment, so this TF1 is for sale now. You can register it with Yamaha and get full warranty from day one. Firmware was upgraded to the latest v.3.01, the newest and cleanest TF1 money can buy. \n \nMy price is more than reasonable: they are $2000-plus elsewhere, and there's hardly any used TF1's on the market now -- people just not selling them! Google \"Yamaha TF1\", you'd be surprised by for how much it sells even online! So your only option will be either to get a new one at full retail, or to get mine in the same new condition for at least $500 less. \n \nChannel structure is similar to well-known Yamaha 01v96 mixer: first input layer (1-16) is coming from onboard inputs (combo XLR-TRS jacks), second (17-32) is either USB or card inputs and outputs. Actually it has 20 onboard inputs, counting two pairs of stereo ins: you can use those for keyboards or drums submixes, or USB playback, leaving the rest for mono sources like mics and guitars. You can mix a typical 4-5 piece band on TF1 just fine, without any add-ons (most bands fit into 16 channels or less). \n \nYou don't really need a snake with this mixer: leave it on stage, plug everything in and let musicians control their own monitor mixes right there, while sound guy can mix the FOH from anywhere in audience using iPad or laptop. \n \nTF1 allows individual per-channel input routing, not in blocks of 8 like X32/M32. Very convenient if you are using backing tracks from DAW during live performance: you can have 16-20 \"live\" inputs coming from stage combined with up to 34 DAW tracks (or any combination thereof).  If using Dante card input, you can have any Dante-compatible stage box feeding all 32 inputs from stage if desired (I doubt if it will be needed, realistically most 4-5 piece bands can fit into 16 channels or less). Dante is an audio communication protocol that allows up to 64 channels to be transmitted via single thin CAT5 Ethernet cable (pretty much a phone cord). Every respectable console manufacturer has Dante-compatible stage boxes, so you can use it with Soundcraft, MIDAS, Allen and Heath, Focusrite RedNet, they are all compatible. \n \nNice feature is \"Sub\" bus. It's actually a third main bus (what others call \"mono\" or \"center\", you can use it that way), but the most important is that it has a LPF (low-pass filter), thus eliminating the need for crossover. Having separate \"subwoofer\" bus allows to route there only bass instruments (kick drum, bass guitar, bass synth), rather than filtering full mix, thus making low end tight, punchy and not muddy when using just a crossover. \n \nMixer also works as a full-featured 34x34 USB audio interface (34 tracks can be simultaneously recorded and played back from DAW via single USB cable!). Allows you to have full multi-track recording of your performance (not just two-channel stereo), where every input will be recorded on a separate track and later finished in the studio.  \n \nIt's also a great recording console for home or project studios. Can be used with any DAW: Pro Tools, Logic, Cubase, Nuendo, Reaper, to name a few, with more flexibility and better preamps than in older \"studio\" desks such as 01v96, DM1000, 02r96, DM2000, etc. Even if you have no experience with DAWs, you can download free Waves Tracks or Reaper, capture your performance and just give files to someone who can finish them up in Pro Tools. \n \nWhat makes it special -- no surprise -- is the sound. Decades of research and development that made Yamaha digital consoles a standard in pro sound, all it shines in TF desks. And what makes it so easy to use are two things: a MULTI-TOUCH display (yes, you can scroll, pinch, zoom, tap, move virtual sliders just like on iPad. None of other digital mixers can do that, even Yamaha's own CL, QL and PM10! (those have touch screens but only single-touch, means you can select the parameter on the touch screen but can't turn, move, drag, pinch, zoom and do any of multi-touch gestures what TF desks can do). Second is Yamaha's patented \"1-knob\" approach to everything, lets you dial that perfect EQ, compressor, effect with one knob only, using Yamaha's preset algorithms (although you can have full control over all parameters such as gain, frequency, Q (bandwidth), threshold, attack, release, etc.) \n \nIt's the easiest desk for monitor mixing: has no less than 20 (twenty!) monitor mixes, last six are stereo mixes for in-ears. Seriously, you can have 8 floor wedge monitors for choir plus six stereo in-ears for band musicians, all mixed independently. (The next desks in Yamaha lineup with that many monitor mixes are $20K-plus (even used) PM5D and CL series). All auxes can be stereo-linked, giving you 10 STEREO in-ear monitor mixes, more than plenty for a typical band or church service. (None of competitors can do that). All auxes work in sends-on-faders mode, and up to 10 iOS devices (iPhones or iPads) can be used as personal monitor mixers by musicians. In fact you are getting a full functionality of an Aviom personal monitor mixers for free and without 16-channel limitation of Aviom! \n \nAnother feature that makes soundman's  life easy is on-screen RTA (Real-Time Analyzer). You see the whole audio spectrum right on the screen, overlaying EQ. Typical task of eliminating feedback with graphic EQ is a piece of cake: just look at the screen where the offending peak is and simply pull down the corresponding slider, right on screen too. You don't need to have a \"golden ears\" of a seasoned sound engineer or even know what that frequency it is: TF1 does it for you! All 8 wedge monitor outputs already have GEQs assigned to them, no need to route or mount anything. \n \nHere's a very detailed review from FOH magazine: \n \n\"For years, Yamaha's digital mixers seem to set a standard by which other consoles are judged. There is no question that the PM1D, PM5D and M7CL are legendary consoles that defined their respective time periods and market segments. The CL and QL series consoles are no exception, and the PM10 Rivage is poised to be another staple of large-scale productions, much like its predecessor the PM1D. \n \nIn the high-end of the digital console market, there are a plethora of exceptional consoles that are worthy of their price tags. The top of the line consoles are so feature-rich and sound so amazing that it's almost difficult to be wowed by them anymore. What has impressed me over the last few years has not been in the high end of the market, but at the lower end of the price spectrum. \n \nEnter the TF series of consoles. Based on Yamaha's TouchFlow technology, the TF series are truly one of-a-kind consoles that only Yamaha could deliver at this price point! Drawing on almost 30 years of digital console R&D and manufacturing experience, the TF series has something for everyone, from working musicians running their own sound, to the seasoned engineer needing an affordable, compact and feature-rich console. The TF line is clearly aimed at an underserved but growing market of users who require the flexibility and power of a digital console at an affordable price. But don't let its target market fool you, the TF series is packed with features often found on consoles costing four times as much. \n \nUnder each input channel's scribble strip is a bright and colorful strip used to color-code channels into logical groupings. The scribble strip itself is also very large and high resolution. Once the TF fully booted for the first time, a tutorial appeared on the multi-touch screen that gave a rundown on some of the main features and console workflows. In typical fashion, I wanted to close the tutorial and dive right in, but I resisted the urge and powered through it, and it was actually very helpful. \n \nAs I started to move my way around the surface, I really appreciated the layout and ergonomics, long one of Yamaha's strong suit. The multi-touch screen is responsive, and the GUI elements are just the right size for touch operation. While the screen is more than bright enough for indoor operation, it won't be bright enough outdoors, so break out the cardboard sunhood that you've fashioned for your other digital consoles. The buttons have a nice click that provides tactile feedback, and the knobs have an incremental click offering a feeling of precision control. The faders felt fairly smooth, although the fader caps themselves look and feel a bit cheap. For a console at this price point, I can't complain about the overall aesthetics. As I finished my cursory overview of the surface, I found a nice resting place for an iPad to run Yamaha's TF StageMix application. \n \nWorking my way down the input channel strip, I found a layout familiar to any Yamaha user; the head amp, a 4-band EQ + high pass filter, a compressor, a gate and routing section. However, there were a few unique features that were jumping out at me. \n \nEntering the head amp section of the TF, I found a distinctive graphical level display that Yamaha calls \"GainFinder.\" In an attempt to make setting gain structure more intuitive, there is a 5-segment horizontal meter, the center bar of which is a large green indicator denoting \"ideal\" gain structure. This is coupled with a more traditional vertical meter to the right, providing excellent visual feedback about the gain setting for each input. \n \nSecond, the multi-touch screen is excellent for dealing with the input equalizers. The multi-touch screen was very responsive, but is admittedly not for everyone. Some engineers prefer the precision of a knob, so Yamaha has included a \"touch and turn\" knob below the lower right corner of the display, as well as four totally programmable user-defined knobs below the screen. What really caught my eye in the EQ section was a unique function called \"1-knob.\" The EQ section can be operated in the traditional style, with complete control over the parameters of each filter, or you can switch to \"1-knob.\" \n \nThe 1-knob mode has two different settings; Intensity and Vocal. The Intensity mode is the default, which varies the gains of the filters you already have in place. For example, let's say on your kick drum you've got a 6 dB boost at 70 Hz, and a 6 dB cut at 300 Hz. When you engage 1-knob and start to apply it, it will boost your 60 Hz filter even more, and cut your 300 Hz filter further as well. It seems to only modify the gain of filters you already have engaged, and doesn't touch the frequency or Q, hence the name \"Intensity.\" If you switch to the Vocal 1-knob mode, the first thing that happens is the EQ is flattened. As you dial up 1-knob in Vocal mode, it applies varying degrees of \"typical\" vocal equalization that will feel familiar to any experienced engineer. \n \nThe input channels also include a wealth of presets available to help speed up the EQ workflow. These aren't just generic kick, snare, bass, guitar and vocal presets, but rather a well-thought-out set of presets that are specific to many instrument and microphone combinations. Yamaha developed these equalizer presets in conjunction with Shure, Sennheiser and Audio-Technica, as well as a host of respected sound engineers with decades of mixing experience. \n \nSpeaking of presets, a full complement of onboard Yamaha effects are available, including an assortment of reverbs, mono/stereo delays, echo, flange, phaser and multiband compressors, derived from its larger siblings: CL, QL and the newest PM-10. \n \nAll TF consoles have a generous eight mono and six stereo auxes, and the mono auxes can be linked as stereo pairs if necessary. What is really striking is the TF's emphasis on the \"Sends on Fader\" workflow for monitor mixing. As with most digital consoles, the TF provides several ways to do virtually everything, but console design promotes the use of \"Sends on Faders\" as the best method for mixing monitors. The right edge of the console has an entire panel of buttons devoted to this feature, so every mix is immediately available with a single button press. \n \nWhile sends on faders has been given a prominent place on the TF's surface, it doesn't quite tell the whole story. All TF models include the ability to have up to ten iOS devices controlling aux sends, using Yamaha's MonitorMix application. Couple that with up to three additional devices running TF StageMix or TF Editor, and even a large band can have independent control of their monitor mixes, reducing the demands placed on the engineer. \n \nOther Features: It's worth pointing out that I didn't touch the user manual once in this entire process, and I never felt I needed it because the console was so intuitive. It did take me a few minutes to find the eight DCA's, but once I discovered them, I found them easy to program, and they have an automatic \"rollout\" (or \"DCA Spill\") feature that spills channels assigned to the selected DCA across the surface. I could easily mix an entire show just from the DCA bank because of the rollout feature, but Yamaha has also included a custom user bank where you can include any combination of inputs, output masters or DCA's. \n \nI also discovered three small but ingenious buttons across the surface. First, a dedicated \"Tap\" button for tapping delay tempos. No, not a button that can be programmed as a tap tempo, but a button that actually says \"Tap\" on it, and flashes in sync with the current tempo. In the upper right of the console surface, I found two mute buttons labeled \"Input\" and \"FX.\" Essentially preprogrammed mute groups, these buttons are dedicated to the two most common mute group applications; muting all inputs, and muting all effects. Brilliant! Finally, for those who need the more traditional Yamaha \"User Defined Keys,\" those exist as well, directly to the right of the multi-touch display. \n \nA free download from Yamaha's website, TF Editor is a computer program that lets users use a PC to edit TF series console settings while away from the console in offline mode or -- in an online mode-- operate the console via the computer while it's connected to the console.  \n \nAll features are great, but the sound of the console is critical. Using some industry standard Shure and E-V mics, along with pre-recorded tracks, I quickly established gain structure on both microphones and my tracks using the GainFinder feature. Based on Yamaha's D-PRE mic amps, console's recallable (yet discrete-design) preamps were transparent sounding and true to both voice and the mics. Yamaha's documentation states the preamp was \"painstakingly designed with a flat, wide frequency response that retains the tone and nuance of the original sound,\" and what I heard lives up to their description. Apparently it uses several discrete circuits, as you raise the gain you hear two distinct relay clicks (similar to old M7CL), when preamp switches from lower gain to higher gain circuit. \n \nThe EQ's felt responsive as well, and I was able to discern even the slightest change, whereas on some consoles I feel like I have to cut 3 dB or more before hearing any appreciable change in tone. I also tested out the 1-Knob EQ in Vocal mode on the SM58 channel, and it performed just as I expected; a typical vocal response curve, with a dip in the low-mids to compensate for proximity effect, and a slight rise in the high-mids to add some presence. This gets you there (or close to it) fast, which can really come in handy in a live environment \n \nConclusion: I found the TF series to be one of the most compelling digital consoles I've used in the last few years. The features contained in the TF desks would have cost upwards of $20,000 just five years ago, so the fact that these consoles sit in the sub-$5,000 market is truly astonishing. The console is the perfect blend of musician friendly ease-of-use and professional level control. It will be difficult for any other company to top what Yamaha has done with these consoles.\" \n \nSince you see this ad now, it means that mixer is STILL AVAILABLE. Emails asking that stupid question (or \"Do you still have it?\") will be treated as scam and ignored, you won't get a reply.  \n \nCan be seen in San Mateo pretty much any day before 7.30pm., or in Sunnyvale after 8pm. I have all that's needed to test it (mics, speakers, etc), and it's under full factory warranty anyway.

Add the lovely, real wood veneer that graces Polk's RTi series, and you've got yourself great sound that looks gorgeous in your room. \n \nHere's how: with a 1\" silk/polymer dome tweeter, the RTi70 delivers stellar treble extension, with clear, detailed response. Mids and lows are full and satisfying, thanks to twin 6-1/2\" Dynamic Balance\u00c2\u00ae drivers -- and Polk's unique Power Port\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 technology makes for bass that you can feel as well as hear. Innovative features, like a raised bezel and anti-diffraction grille, result in a large, open, three-dimensional soundstage with pinpoint-accurate stereo imaging; because the grille frame mounts flush to the bezel, unwanted grille diffraction is minimized.

It's a LowePro Streamline 150, a very well made bag. And it doesn't scream camera bag. It's pretty stylish. It has a padded slot with a divider for compact camera equipment. My Sony NEX-6 mirrorless micro four thirds camera with lens attached fits in the small padded camera pocket, and the external flash and extra batteries fit in the other padded pocket. (I added a photo of the NEX-6 to show you roughly how big it is, but it is NOT included in this sale!) It has another padded slot for a 7\" tablet which fit my small Kindle. My iPad mini fits in the main compartment. It has lots of pockets, which I think is great. \n \nI liked it so much I kept taking the camera out of it and using it as a handbag, so I bought another one, which I have only used maybe twice. So the second one which I am selling is still quite new. It's normally $39 and you usually can't find it any lower than $29 brand new, often plus shipping.

{"title": "Lake Tahoe Condo for wine or other cool stuff", "price": null, "priceUnit": null, "cityName": null, "description": "\n         \nPlease see calendar below before asking me for availability! \n \nMy newly renovated south lake tahoe area vacation rental condo in Stateline (kingsbury), NV is right near the Heavenly ski resort. It's a great place in the summer and fall, close to hiking, mountain biking, etc. If you'd like to use it some time and have something nice to barter let me know. Note that you'd still have to pay the $75 cleaning fee, since that gets paid straight to the cleaning person. \n \n It's not far from the lake, and also near the fox and hound restaurant, thai food, pizza, and other restaurants. If you want to drive to the casinos that's available too. It's also very close to the blue go line's bus stop. Since I'm part of the Tahoe village association you'll have access to the neighborhood pool and hot tub, which is nearby. \n \n In terms of amenities, I have a 42\" flat screen TV and a DVD player. I have wireless internet access (wifi). It is fully furnished with a full kitchen. The kitchen has plates, cups, pots and pans, etc. \n \n The bedroom has a queen bed and a full sized bed. The couch folds out to a queen sized bed as well.  \n \n I also have some movies for the DVD player, but I don't have a list. \n \n Washer and dryer in unit \n \n Note that this is a condo in Tahoe so you'd have to trade something of real value (e.g. road bicycle or mountain bike, gift cards, good wine / your wine collection or wine refrigerator, Ipad, giants, 49ers, Raiders or warriors tickets (or a lot of A's tickets), non-musty good quality camping equipment,  bluray disks, etc. I may also be interested in doing a home exchange / house swap if you had a place of interest. I'm fairly open, so let me know what you've got. \n \n If you don't have anything to barter and want to simply rent it, my normal Summer rates are as folllows: $90 / night on weekdays and on the weekend for just $110 per night, plus the taxes and $75 cleaning fee. If you want to stay for a 3 or 4 day weekend, each it's just $80 more per weekday instead of the $90. Why so inexpensive? I'm really just trying to cover my costs and not looking to have this as a big moneymaker. If I break even and get to use it a few times I'm happy. \n \n Not far from Zepher cove. An hour + from Reno, 1/2 hour from carson city. You could head over to the gondola, visit the shops by the marriott Timber Lodge, etc. Note - not a house or a cabin or a timeshare. Its a condo. \n \n It is an officially approved unit by the Douglas County community development department. APN # 1319-30-640-002. Maximum capacity = 6 people. \n \nMore pictures are available. Please feel free to email with any questions  \n \nHere is when it is booked.

{"title": "DJI Inspire 1 quadcopter drone w 4k video", "price": "2000", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "los altos", "description": "\n         \nLike new - DJI Inspire 1 Quadcopter with 4K Camera and 3-Axis Gimbal and water resistant case. Less than 10 hours flight time. Excellent condition. Never crashed or dropped.  \n \n\u2022 Inspire 1 quadcopter \n\u2022 Zenmuse 3 axis stabilized X3 Camera for 4K Video and 12MP Stills \n\u2022 Up to 1.2 Mile Radio Range \n\u2022 Includes (3) rechargeable smart flight batteries with charger and airplane travel bags \n\u2022 Up to (18) minutes flight time per battery. \n\u2022 Includes HPRC 6 Wheeled Hard Case with Foam \n\u2022 Includes (3) 64gb microSD cards  \n \nFrom manufacturer's website: \n \nCapture 4K professional quality video and take 12-megapixel still photos from the air with the DJI Inspire 1 v2.0 Quadcopter with Integrated Camera and 3-Axis Gimbal. Forgoing the fixed landing gear design found on many earlier quadcopters, the Inspire 1 features a retractable arm system whereby the underside of each prop motor has a foot to act as a landing pod when the arms are lowered. In-flight, the arms lift up to provide the camera an unobstructed 360-degree view. A 3-axis gimbal keeps shots steady and the camera pointed the same direction as the quadcopter banks and turns. The camera records internally to microSDHC/SDXC memory cards and can also beam a live 720p feed to a mobile device running the DJI Lightbridge app or a monitor or FPV glasses with an HDMI input. One transmitter (radio controller) is included and a second can be added so that one operator can pilot and another can pan and tilt the camera.  \n \nAs with many other multi-rotor systems, the Inspire 1 relies on a GPS-based stabilization system that -- thanks to spatial awareness -- is able to hold a position even when experiencing wind interference, can compensate for overzealous pilot inputs to help avoid stalling, automatically brings the aircraft home in the event of signal loss or at the press of a button, and makes possible a number of semi-automated flight modes that can be enabled through the app. There is also an \"indoor\" mode which relies on Vision Positioning technology -- essentially a special camera -- provide stability indoors or in other contexts where GPS is unavailable (Note: certain features will be unavailable in indoor mode).  \n \nThis bundle includes the Inspire 1 along with gimbal and camera, a transmitter, (3) flight batteries, a battery charger, and a tablet holder that mounts on the transmitter. To store and transport the aircraft, a case with fitted cut-outs is included. It holds the Inspire with rotors detached, one or two transmitters, props, spare flight batteries, and more. \n \nZenmuse X5/X5R Compatibility \nIn addition to the included Zenmuse X3, this version of the Inspire 1 also works with the Zenmuse X5 and X5R gimbal cameras (available separately) \n \nNew Propulsion System \nWith the new 3510H motor, the thrust sees a boost. This yields an increase in the motor velocity constant from 350 Kv to 420 Kv. In practice, this translates into better control, especially when using a Zenmuse X5 series gimbal camera \n \nRedesigned Propellers \nTo go with the 3510H motors, new propellers and a new propeller mounting system have been introduced. They employ an updated mounting system, designed to make attaching and removing the propellers easier than ever before \n \nWhat Ready-to-Fly Means \nThis Inspire 1 bundle comes ready-to-fly (RTF). This means a pre-bound transmitter (radio controller) is included and that no major assembly is required -- in particular, no assembly that requires soldering. It is important -- as with any multi-rotor -- to follow the user guide to ensure proper calibration before embarking on your first flight \n \nIntegrated 4K Camera \n4K and HD Video Capture \nThe Inspire 1 Camera shoots 4K video at 24p and 30p, and it can shoot HD video frame rates from 24p to 60p. It features a 1/2.3\" CMOS sensor with a 94-degree field of view (FOV) lens. This field of view works out to about 20mm in 35mm equivalent, which gives you a wide but not extremely wide or fisheye framing, this FOV features less distortion and gives the subject more emphasis \n \n3-Axis Gimbal \nThe camera is mounted via an integrated 3-axis gimbal which uses brushless servo motors to keep the shot stable and the horizon level. The camera pans a full 360-degrees so that no matter which way the quadcopter turns, the camera can remain locked on the subject. Manual panning and tilting can be affected using controls on the transmitter \n \nLive HD View \nA real-time feed from the Inspire 1 Camera can be displayed in 720p HD on a mobile device or HDMI monitor, making this it a great choice for FPV (first-person view) flying as well as enabling videographers and photographers to monitor framing from the ground. This is made possible by the inclusion of the DJI Lightbridge system within the flight electronics, which features a range of up to 1.2 miles \n \nFor connecting an FPV monitor or glasses there is an HDMI port on the transmitter. Plus there is a USB port to keep you mobile device's battery topped up. And included mount allows you to attach a smartphone or tablet directly to the transmitter \n \nModular Gimbal and Camera \nInspire 1's gimbal and camera can be removed from the aircraft for safe transport and future upgrades \nAirframe Design \n \nRetractable Carbon Fiber Arms \nThe prop arms rest in a lowered position when the Inspire is on the ground, acting as landing gear. Once in the air, they can be retracted to give the camera unobstructed views across 360-degrees. Carbon fiber is used in the construction because of its high strength to weight ratio \n \nAerodynamic Design \nNot only does it give the Inspire 1 a sleek look, the aerodynamic airframe helps reduce resistance for better performance and increased battery life \n \nFlight Control System \nFly Indoors and Without GPS \nDJI's Optical Flow technology uses a specially designed camera as well as sonic waves to provide the same stability function indoors as GPS does outdoors. This technology allows the Inspire to hold its location, stop when the controls are released, and quickly respond to pilot commands even when GPS is unavailable \n \nApp-Based Control Software \nEverything from manual camera controls to flight telemetry -- even auto takeoff and landing -- can be accessed via the Inspire 1 Mobile app. It is also possible to create autopilot courses using waypoints, just as you would on the DJI iPad Ground Station System \n \nNote: The tablet or smartphone must be connected to the transmitter via USB, and to use the waypoint map an Internet connection is required \n \nManual Mode \nChange all of your camera settings, including ISO, White Balance, Exposure, and more on the fly ensuring every shot looks exactly the way you want \n \nLive Map and Radar \nSee precisely where your Inspire 1 is at all times on the live map. The map can be enlarged when needed, and shows your most recent flight path \n \nDynamic Home Point \nWhen GPS signal is available on the transmitter (remote control), the Home Point automatically refreshes. This becomes useful while traveling in a car or on a boat allowing the return-to-home point to move where the operator goes. Multiple configurations are available via the Dynamic Home Point function \n \nAuto-Takeoff and Landing \nTakeoff and landing are available with just a tap. Tap once to takeoff and your Inspire 1 will hover and transform, ready to start filming. Then tap again to make it transform into landing mode and auto land \n \nTransmitter Customization \nPut yourself in charge by tailoring the Inspire 1's controls to your personal needs. This way, your Inspire 1 moves and responds in ways you're most comfortable with \n \nTransmitter (Radio Controller) \nTake control of your Inspire 1 in the air with a dedicated transmitter (radio controller) designed specifically for it. Operating on 2.4 GHz, it features dedicated buttons for photo and video capture, a gimbal control dial, and more. It includes an integrated 6000mAh rechargeable battery \n \nUse Two Transmitters \nFor an even greater level of precision, use a second transmitter and fly with a friend. With two people controlling the same quadcopter, one person pilots the flight path while the other aims the gimbal and camera. Each user can have their own screen to see exactly what is being shot in real-time \n \nSmart Battery System \nSmart Power Management \nThe flight battery constantly supplies the flight computer with remaining voltage. Using special algorithms the computer supplies the pilot with estimates of remaining flying distance and time to return home \n \nAutomated Charging \nThe battery tracks the voltage of each cell, the total number of charges and discharges, and the overall health and battery status    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_sysRq1IeON_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_fav4TAZv6RV_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_kkEfoH4O5Ml_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00404_kVNPH8S2l7X_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_k3usF5jQiPh_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_2iBLJeYOckD_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00202_k6WMgBoLe0i_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_48R1YbIyjv7_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_9tE3RwJyDyY_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00404_8gTYH0KlMF1_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_bm0ytMv8faX_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01717_iLJyWofdhlW_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00000_aiM35zPgzn0_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_bFzbt5v54Ns_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_hjJIwEHEgkO_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_5jYoz99BSUC_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.363199", "lng": "-122.119217", "postId": "5947151893", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/pho/5947151893.html", "postDate": "2017-01-05T14:37:49-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-08T14:53:21-0800", "attributes": "like new", "locAccuracy": "highest", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/pho/5947151893", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:51:50.214661", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

That was our intent behind the JBL\u00ae OnBeat Rumble\u2122 wireless loudspeaker dock: floor-thumping, room-shaking sound from your iPhone 5, iPad mini and other latest-generation devices, including smartphones, tablets and laptops. Because it features Bluetooth\u00ae connectivity with HARMAN TrueStream\u2122 technology, you can use any device that's Bluetooth-enabled and hear all of your audio with power and clarity. The dock is equipped with the Lightning connector, so you can charge your iPhone 5 and iPad mini while blasting music, watching videos, or playing games. But let's not forget about the dock's incredible sound -- an oversized, down-firing subwoofer provides rumbling bass that you can feel in your bones. \n \nFor a more intimate experience, you can use your own headphones -- just plug them into the onboard headphone jack. The JBL OnBeat Rumble dock works with our free JBL\u00ae MusicFlow\u2122 app, which empowers you to edit playlists and dial in your EQ settings, and can be used with your own favorite DJ mixer app from Apple App Store. \n \nWhether you're using this powerful dock for music or movies, one thing is for sure: You'll feel the rumble.  \n \nDimensions & Weight: 6-11/16\" (169mm) X 17-13/16\" (453mm) X 8-13/16\" (223mm) (HxWxD)    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_8nM344iszsX_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00707_3ilRV4JKybI_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_bvUBPBaH0tX_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_k2Gj0JP9qP2_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_ePmV9ARI67R_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00909_dYA2tDkge2y_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00O0O_9ei4gamonYm_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_hNRrZMtCANF_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_8mVlLvBoCeu_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_i19f2z1Hg5P_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_hM0fx59ol0m_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_kA9KDRjAzno_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_9nRR56UGCyD_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_8mmU7iNPkFC_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.343355", "lng": "-121.885976", "postId": "5937924271", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/ele/5937924271.html", "postDate": "2016-12-29T14:35:04-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-08T12:53:54-0800", "attributes": "new JBL OnBeat Rumble", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/ele/5937924271", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:51:50.660096", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "Professional Drone Kit, Everything Included", "price": "3800", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "Chico", "description": "\n         \nWe are selling our professional drone. Get into the rapidly expanding drone industry and start making money today. This drone comes equipped with everything you need to create professional drone photos and videos. This drone also includes everything for use in the Ag industry to create overhead maps with standard RGB and also NDVI images, all in the same flight. \nThe Drone: \nThe drone is a Tarot T810 hexacopter frame. Equipped with six 15\" props, Naza V2 flight controller, a 3 axis gimbal with Alexmos Basecam 32bit gimbal controller with 2 IMU's, and retractable landing gear. The drone is equipped with FPV so you can see what the drone sees as you fly it on the included Lilliput screen. Comes equipped with Naza 2.4 G Bluetooth data link so you can make predetermined flight plans in your iPad or computer and fly the drone hands free. It comes with a Futaba T10J transmitter which can also be used to control the gimbal. The drone runs on 2 8000 mAh batteries and flys for 15-20 mins per charge and has enough lift to carry heavy cameras. The drone comes with 4 batteries, enough for 2 flights. A dual charger so you can charge 2 batteries at once. Each charge takes 30mins-1hr depending on the charge type.  \n \nProfessional Photo/Videos: \nThe drone comes with a Sony NEX5 16.1 mega pixel camera that takes extremely high quality photos and 1080p video. The camera can be triggered from the ground to snap photos or video. The gimbal can also be adjusted from the ground to pan up and down. The gimbal keeps the camera stable to make smooth videos ready for post processing. Comes equipped with FPV for the NEX5 so you can see what you are shooting in real time. The retractable landing gear keeps the landing gear out of the way so they don't get in your shot. Contact me if you would like to see examples.  \n \nAgriculture monitoring: \nThis drone comes with 2 GoPro's, one a 3 and one a 3+. One GoPro comes equipped with an IRPro NDVI-7 lens for taking near infrared photos for creating a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index which is used to determine the density of vegetation, a useful tool in determining plant health and locating problem areas in your crop quickly. The second GoPro is equipped with a traditional RGB lens for taking standard pics/vids. Both lenses are flat instead of the fisheye lenses GoPro is known for. We utilize the Naza 2.4 G Bluetooth data link to hook up to our iPad and map out our flights over crops/orchards and the drone will fly itself automatically. We stitch together the images from the GoPro to create 2 overhead maps in each flight, one NDVI and one standard RGB. The drone can cover a 50-80 acre plot of land in one charge. The drone is also equipped with a GoPro FPV chord so you can see what the drone sees in real time. The NEX5 can also be used to create higher quality maps.  \nExtras: \nThis package includes everything you need to fly and start making money today. Comes with 4 extra props, one extra motor, several extra GoPro batteries, extra GoPro accessories for nearly every mounting need. Comes with an iOSd mini for changing flight controller settings from your phone or iPad. Comes with a lot of extra wires and all the tools needed for fixing/maintaining the drone. Comes with an extra set of landing gear. Carrying cases for protection on most of the gear. Selling everything mentioned here and seen in the pics for $3800. We also have a brand new, high end Asus gaming laptop that is helpful for editing video and stitching together Ag maps that we are willing to sell also if interested. If you are interested or have any questions, feel free to call, text, or email me. I can also show you how to use everything.

If you don't know about it this amp is a studio powerhouse with more features than I know what to do with. \n \nOVERVIEW \nA rack-mountable head made to dominate your studio. \n \nFeaturing the same great Ironheart tones as the bigger heads but in a low-wattage studio package with some neat features added. \n \nIt would be nice to record in a situation where making a lot of noise was not an problem, but in most cases people are recording in home studios, and making a lot of noise is not always an option. So the Ironheart IRT-Studio has a couple of features designed specifically to allow you to get a great tone whether you are recording in the studio or recording live. \n \nThe IRT-Studio features a USB Audio I/O and a RE-AMP send jack. The USB supplies both a dry signal and the processed signal - split left and right to your DAW - directly into either your PC/Mac or iPad, which means that you can alter the guitar tone of your original recording - without having to re-track anything! \n \nThe IRT-Studio has an internal dummy load, so, unlike a conventional tube-loaded amp, you don't need to connect an external speaker - which gives you truly silent recording! \n \nIt also houses a high-quality speaker-emulated record out immediately after the output section, which means it delivers all-tube tone to your DAW or PA or both at the same time for recording your live shows. \n \nFEATURES \nPower: 15W (tube) \nTubes: three 12AX7 (preamp); two EL84 (power amp) \nThree footswitchable channels \nTwo inputs: 15W and <1W \nControls: 3-band EQ, push-pull EQ shift, presence, pre-boost, volume, gain \nBuilt-in reverb \nFX loop \nSpeaker-emulated line out \nInternal dummy load for silent recording \nAux. input \nXLR line out \nUSB connectivity for direct recording \nGig bag included \nRack wings included \nFootswitch included \n \nComes with skb case and footswitch \n \nI am slightly open to trades of the musical nature.  \n \nMike \n\n  \n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": "37.347600", "lng": "-121.887000", "postId": "5951354465", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/msg/5951354465.html", "postDate": "2017-01-08T19:26:11-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "Laney Ironheart IRT-Studio", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/msg/5951354465", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:51:52.764330", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

This guitar is black in color and has a white single ply pick guard.   The pick guard has typical pick scratches from use.  Other than that there are no cracks or scratches to be found.

{"title": "Lake Tahoe Condo for wine or other cool stuff", "price": null, "priceUnit": null, "cityName": null, "description": "\n         \nPlease see calendar below before asking me for availability! \n \nMy newly renovated south lake tahoe area vacation rental condo in Stateline (kingsbury), NV is right near the Heavenly ski resort. It's a great place in the summer and fall, close to hiking, mountain biking, etc. If you'd like to use it some time and have something nice to barter let me know. Note that you'd still have to pay the $75 cleaning fee, since that gets paid straight to the cleaning person. \n \n It's not far from the lake, and also near the fox and hound restaurant, thai food, pizza, and other restaurants. If you want to drive to the casinos that's available too. It's also very close to the blue go line's bus stop. Since I'm part of the Tahoe village association you'll have access to the neighborhood pool and hot tub, which is nearby. \n \n In terms of amenities, I have a 42\" flat screen TV and a DVD player. I have wireless internet access (wifi). It is fully furnished with a full kitchen. The kitchen has plates, cups, pots and pans, etc. \n \n The bedroom has a queen bed and a full sized bed. The couch folds out to a queen sized bed as well.  \n \n I also have some movies for the DVD player, but I don't have a list. \n \n Washer and dryer in unit \n \n Note that this is a condo in Tahoe so you'd have to trade something of real value (e.g. road bicycle or mountain bike, gift cards, good wine / your wine collection or wine refrigerator, Ipad, giants, 49ers, Raiders or warriors tickets (or a lot of A's tickets), non-musty good quality camping equipment,  bluray disks, etc. I may also be interested in doing a home exchange / house swap if you had a place of interest. I'm fairly open, so let me know what you've got. \n \n If you don't have anything to barter and want to simply rent it, my normal winter rates are as follows: $90 / night on weekdays and on the weekend for just $110 per night, plus the taxes and $75 cleaning fee. If you want to stay for a 3 or 4 day weekend, each it's just $80 more per weekday instead of the $90. Why so inexpensive? I'm really just trying to cover my costs and not looking to have this as a big moneymaker. If I break even and get to use it a few times I'm happy. \n \n Not far from Zepher cove. An hour + from Reno, 1/2 hour from carson city. You could head over to the gondola, visit the shops by the marriott Timber Lodge, etc. Note - not a house or a cabin or a timeshare. Its a condo. \n \n It is an officially approved unit by the Douglas County community development department. APN # 1319-30-640-002. Maximum capacity = 6 people. \n \nMore pictures are available. Please feel free to email with any questions  \n \nHere is when it is booked.

{"title": "Mackie DL1608 Digital Mixer with Wi-Fi Router", "price": "599", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "millbrae", "description": "\n         \nDigital mixer of the year, the ultra-compact 16-channel 8-bus Mackie DL-1608. Wireless remote control from iPad and iPhone from anywhere in the venue, ton of features that doesn't exist in other analog and digital mixers, and all this fits in a standard laptop bag! \n \n- Excellent ONYX mic preamps, the same as in ONYX-80 series large format analog mixers and ONYX recording interfaces. Accept ANY signal source, from condenser mics to line-level (keyboards, digital drums, iPhone/iPod, CD player, etc.) \n- Full digital control, including scenes memory and recall.  \n- 4-band fully parametric EQ and full dynamics suite (compressor, limiter, gate, expander) on each and every input and output. \n- Eight 31-band graphic equalizers with +/- 15dB range (more than typical 12dB), also with unique \"Draw\" feature (let you draw a desired EQ curve right on iPad, instead of moving each slider separately). \n- Two independent effects processors with all the stuff you may need for a gig: reverbs, delays, etc. \n- Channels and effects preset libraries. Real time saver, you can load typical preset like \"Kick drum\", \"Piano\", \"Guitar\", Female VOX\", etc, it gets 90% of job done, then you can tweak it to your taste. \n- Instant one-button two-track or multi-track recording straight to iPad. You can record your event as multitrack session and later polish it in a studio with any DAW (ProTools, Logic, Cubase, etc.) \n- Remote levels control from any iPhone or iPod Touch. You can let musicians dial their own monitor mixes (up to 6 independent mono mixes). This feature is a lifesaver, no more \"I can't hear myself in monitors\" or \"I need more of this and that\"). In fact you are getting a full functionality of an Aviom personal monitor mixers for free: everyone has an iPhone today, all you need is to download a free app! \n \nDL1608 can easily handle a typical 4-5 piece band gig (most bands fit into 16-channel grid, even with fully miked drum kit, and never need more than 6 separate monitor mixes). I've done plenty of cover bands with this mixer. \n \nToo many features to list here, read online reviews or download MasterFader app to your iPad and try it in demo mode, it's awesome! New version 4.0 adds bunch of new features: custom channel layers, VCAs, 6-band parametric EQ on outputs, etc. etc.  \n \nAlso watch MasterFader launch video: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yCGH5mmGaU \n \nThe most comprehensive video tutorial on DL1608 covering the latest MasterFader \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0OnElTV5oo \nIt's an hour long, but covers EVERYTHING, definitely worth watching at least once. \n \nThis is 30-pin dock version (for iPad 1 and 2). Can be used with any iPad model, from Mini to Pro (for newer iPads with Lighting connector you can use a 30-pin-to-Lighting adapter ($29 from Apple Store or around $6 on eBay), or just use Wi-Fi connection. (Note that all other iPad-controlled mixers on the market doesn't even have a dock for iPad, Wi-Fi only!). Mixer hardware is identical in both, so they sounds the same. All the sound processing is done inside of DL-1608, iPad is just the controller (also, if you'll lose Wi-Fi connection to the mixer, nothing will happen, it will still pass audio in the state it was left on). \n \nMixer is in excellent condition, everything works 100%. Selling only the mixer with power supply, iPad is shown just for illustration, how it looks together. Works with all iPad models. Comes with Linksys wireless router, all set up and ready to go. Make sure to download MasterFader app to your iPad before coming if you want to test it (it's also a good way to learn mixer in offline mode). I can test functionality with my iPad if desired. It doesn't take a lot of iPad computing power to work, so the older iPads work fine, and those are dirt cheap today ($100-130 for iPad 2, there's about 400 of them for sale on Craigslist at the moment). \n \nSince you see this ad now, it means the mixer is STILL AVAILABLE    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_1dqWhybXNK_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_8bxMoaAiTfU_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00707_1zWijiED5gb_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00808_5sBk9z0mtSK_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_h4qE1Lg8k9d_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_dnE40El0q8_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_6k7lrCH4XCl_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_bK8NFLb1UoX_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_23T9LbuLGio_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_b58DYLCBhNZ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_lWAml0iZZW3_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.539500", "lng": "-122.299800", "postId": "5913292572", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/msg/5913292572.html", "postDate": "2016-12-10T02:31:01-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-07T00:43:16-0800", "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "highest", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/msg/5913292572", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:52:00.521893", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

These coupes and convertibles can now be had with six-speed manual transmissions to begin with. The exterior has been updated to an even more athletic profile with its lengthy hood and eye-catching crease. Xenon headlights are a terrific new feature as well. Inside, 2014 brings pure luxury. Dakota leather upholstery and door trim and now standard. This is specifically a nice touch to the ten-way power seats for driver and front passenger, not to mention the leather-wrapped steering wheel. Room is still adequate for the backseat passengers who also enjoy the leather. They did not stop there though. All 2014 BMW 6 series are going to see vast improvements to their navigation systems with 10.2-inch display screens. Standards also include a rearview camera and dynamic cruise control. Strong engines and transmissions continue to exist in this series as well as a powerful sound system of 12 speakers and 500-watts that can also be upgraded to the Bang and Olufsen Sound System. Existing upgrades for the tech enthusiast are iPad holders and snap-in adapters for Apple products and Blackberry make working from the car a breeze.

The exterior has been modernized with subtle, yet profile-enhancing, changes to the nose and tail. There are also contour lines around the grille and reshaped air intakes. All models now have adaptive xenon headlamps with LED alternatives available, and new thin-line taillamps are a nice addition for 2014. BMW has expanded both the standard and optional equipment including engine upgrades. The Gran Turismo specifically has received front fascia recasting and an extended liftgate that increases cargo capacity by 2.1-cubic feet. The luxurious outside look has been translated into the comfortable interior of the 5 series as well. Three upgraded trim configurations for 2014 include the Luxury Line, Modern Line, and the M Sport. Other available features are ActiveHybrid or xDrive for AWD. BMW Assist can offer a driver an emergency switchboard, navigation system, and information service all in one on an integrated 10.2-inch screen. The lowest model starts with ten speakers and options are available for many more sound packages. Existing upgrades for the tech enthusiast are iPad holders and snap-in adapters for Apple products and Blackberry make working from the car a breeze. In addition, rear view, side and top view cameras are all options for safety. Standard safety features include airbags, safety belt reminders, anti-theft alarm system, and an interlocking door anchoring system.* Visit Us Today *A short visit to Stevens Creek BMW located at 4343 Stevens Creek Blvd, Santa Clara, CA 95051 can get you a hassle-free deal on this tried-and-true 5 Series today!\n\n \n\n  5\n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/01414_9IpllFbqM8H_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_89ntYDpZaf8_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_fJhh6tSG1SK_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00101_3dlIjsqoHLn_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00202_2E0HwJu2tmj_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_lQ4G63pFFZw_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_8RTuikAHQdt_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_5x8WTHlw7Ev_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_MmfEVWHbL6_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_kdUhaNYgDJf_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_gIJBp75Zmul_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_iC2S7VwTqbg_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00505_hta6J8ZPZ3J_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00S0S_k8Aw8EBuljd_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_l2ll8Venoim_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_3UDoIWjYxJS_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00000_igeSRUfqCtG_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_j4sp3zdHY3B_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00606_i1mmVJaSHz9_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_f8WhCh9AA3F_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01313_dFVmVLPjMbC_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_2ozsMnlZ6B7_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01616_70aEi1aeOF9_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_9pBfkaGmuEX_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.324060", "lng": "-121.977930", "postId": "5943573341", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/ctd/5943573341.html", "postDate": "2017-01-03T08:35:02-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "2014 BMW 5 Series 535d (4dr Sdn 535d RWD) automatic WBAXA5C5XED001881 rwd gas 35084 black clean automatic sedan", "locAccuracy": "highest", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/ctd/5943573341", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:52:07.217892", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

The exterior has been modernized with subtle, yet profile-enhancing, changes to the nose and tail. There are also contour lines around the grille and reshaped air intakes. All models now have adaptive xenon headlamps with LED alternatives available, and new thin-line taillamps are a nice addition for 2014. BMW has expanded both the standard and optional equipment including engine upgrades. The Gran Turismo specifically has received front fascia recasting and an extended liftgate that increases cargo capacity by 2.1-cubic feet. The luxurious outside look has been translated into the comfortable interior of the 5 series as well. Three upgraded trim configurations for 2014 include the Luxury Line, Modern Line, and the M Sport. Other available features are ActiveHybrid or xDrive for AWD. BMW Assist can offer a driver an emergency switchboard, navigation system, and information service all in one on an integrated 10.2-inch screen. The lowest model starts with ten speakers and options are available for many more sound packages. Existing upgrades for the tech enthusiast are iPad holders and snap-in adapters for Apple products and Blackberry make working from the car a breeze. In addition, rear view, side and top view cameras are all options for safety. Standard safety features include airbags, safety belt reminders, anti-theft alarm system, and an interlocking door anchoring system.* Visit Us Today *You've earned this- stop by Stevens Creek BMW located at 4343 Stevens Creek Blvd, Santa Clara, CA 95051 to make this car yours today!

FREE!!! (YES - any decade up through new releases!) \n \nWatch ANY TV SHOW ever made... FREE!!! (AGAIN, any decade, up through today's top series, nicely categorized in menu - pull up by season, then episode!) \n \nWatch LIVE SPORTS - even PPV events - FREE!!! (NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB, GOLF, UFC, BOXING and even international sports like soccer and cricket!) \n \nWatch ADULT-XXX from top sites - Yes... - all FREE!!! (YES - with NO monthly fees hitting your credit card!) \n \n*In addition to Free Movies, TV & Live Sporting events... This box turns your ordinary TV into a SUPER SMART TV (think of your TV as a giant tablet!) - check email, Skype loved ones, Watch You-Tube vids, play andriod-based games from the Play Store or stream Pandora! Download any of Androids 1.3 million apps now in the Play Store directly to your TV.... So throw your chromecast, Roku, altered Apple TV, Amazon Fire Stick or similar device away and donate your DVD library to the Goodwill. A \"MUST HAVE\" for any home theater system!  \n \nStream ANY MOVIE, TV SHOW, ADULT-XXX, LIVE SPORTS, LIVE Premium Channels, etc. Many Movies avl. today are still in theaters! (recently, I've watched The Arrival, Rogue 1, Suicide Squad, Sausage Party, Doctor Strange and Hacksaw Ridge, just to name a few!) Or, use the \"search\" function and type in your favorite movie ever and the Stealth will instantly pull it up in seconds - *Think about it... the ability to pull up ANY MOVIE you want to watch - instantly, on-demand is PRICELESS! You literally will have free and instant access to the LARGEST MOVIE COLLECTION IN THE WORLD!  \n \nPLUG-N-PLAY! *THE ONLY THING REQUIRED IS A HDMI INPUT ON YOUR TV & A GOOD INTERNET CONNECTION (15mbps+) - connect by either Wi-fi -or- Ethernet. *If you're not sure what type of speed you have, contact your internet provider and make sure you are getting at least 15mbps+ download speed (don't worry about the ping or upload speeds). You can also do your own test by visiting speedtest (dot) net  \n \n**Don't be fooled by other cheap Android based Boxes with only 1 GB of RAM or less, or altered boxes (Roku, Apple TV or Firestick)!, our SUPER FAST box has double their speed @ 2 GB of RAM & 8 GB of ROM paired with the fastest CPU in the industry, - those altered boxes mentioned above or cheaper 1 GB Android boxes are KNOWN to overheat, then lock up and eventually burn-out after a few months of straining the CPU..., Don't be fooled into buying an inferior box - with this technology, you get what you pay for! *That is the first, but most important of 3 reasons why the Stealth TV Box is SUPERIOR to all other boxes on the market! **The second of the 3 reasons is the amount of add-ons we offer, which is 100+ Add-ons are like apps on your phone. The Stealth comes pre-loaded with 100+ of the top add-ons, so it will take you months to only scratch the surface of this device! ***Lastly, (third of the 3 reasons) is our ongoing support - DO NOT buy a box that some fly-by-night guy that meets you in a coffee shop has no clue what they are selling you, or even up-to-date on this evolving technology... We have been \"hands-on\" with this technology for over 2 years and will communicate any need to know changes through our YouTube channel at: StealthTVbox/Channel This technology has evolved drastically over the past few years and will continue to evolve and get better with each passing month, so \"support\" is KEY to stay in tuned with the newest and best add-ons, tips, changes, etc. \n \nComes in retail box w/instructions - HDMI cord, remote, and power cord. 1 box is needed per TV... but calculate your monthly cable or satellite bill x 12 months (You're probably giving the cable/satellite giants $2,000+/each year so you will see that getting a 2nd or even 3rd box is still worth the one time price tag. Start with 1, this month - get used to it, then add on another box next month, and so on...  \n \nGet it on ebay (see our feedback!), or with free shipping on our official website - www.stealthtvbox.com (we have to charge shipping on ebay due to high seller fees we have to pay there) \n \nBest of all... The STEALTH TV BOX is TOTALLY LEGAL! It uses \"open-source\" software to connect to various servers via the world-wide-web, hence you are NOT \"stealing\" a particular satellite or cable company feed! Being NO CONTENT is ever downloaded onto your hard drive, our device is nothing more than a mini computer that only \"streams\" content (never downloads) - thus makes the Stealth legal for us to sell, and you to buy! How is that, you say? On Feb. 26th, 2015 the FCC passed \"net neutrality and open internet rules\" in consumers favor which make \"streaming\" in the comfort of your home legal, as long as you are not \"downloading\" (and redistributing) copyrighted content. Think of it like this - owning a gun is legal, however what you do with it makes all the difference, so play by the FCC rules that state you may \"stream\" content which is already in, what we call the \"internet cloud.\"  \n \n**NOTE: We solely own the Stealth TV Box name, photos and logo(s) so photos are strictly protected and Trade Marked, so please do NOT steal our photos or you will be dealt with accordingly, with legal actions.

Kata 466-DL", "price": "45", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "santa rosa", "description": "\n         \nBRAND NEW..... \n \nRetail Price... $ 129.00 \nAsking Price.. $ 45.00 \n \nThe black Digital Rucksack 466-DL from Kata is a slightly larger version of Kata's Digital Rucksack 465-DL. Even with the 466's larger capacity, it remains a compact, lightweight and structural sound rucksack that can also be used as a standard daypack or sling-style bag. With its capacity to hold a DSLR system with 3-4 standard lenses as well as personals and accessories, this rucksack will get you through a gig or a family walk in the park. It's also rated to hold your 15.4\" laptop in its own padded compartment. \n \nThe interior of the bag is made from Kata's tough Aeriform Foam-EVA (ethyl vinyl acetate) and EVE (polyethylene), plus the overall construction features their unique TST (Thermo Shield Technology) rib structural design that provides additional strength to the areas of the bag that are most subject to shock. Strong, adjustable and padded shoulder straps deliver comfort while on the road and a sternum strap helps maintain stability while you walk. \n \nThe bag itself contains four zippered storage areas with the top designed for your personals and the bottom for photo gear. Plenty of accessories will fit inside including a flash, small computer, documents and iPad. A removable bottom insert allows you to transform the rucksack into a handy daypack. The exterior contains a side cup that can be used to either hold the legs of your tripod or a water bottle. \n \nOptional Kata Camera Strap PL can be attached to the bag's D-rings to help alleviate the weight of your DSLR when hung around your neck. For even more convenience, the rucksack will accept Kata's optional Insertrolley that will allow you to effortlessly roll your pack through parking lots and up ramps. A built-in rain cover will protect you when the weather turns sour. This is a very useful, lightweight everday bag that meets the need of anyone who wants a strong and flexible way to carry a wide variety of photo and personal gear. It's backed by Kata's five-year warranty. \n \nTST Rib \nTST (Thermo Shield Technology) is a discreet solution that provides the perfect shock protection for your gear while creating an extremely lightweight product. It is featured on the most important areas of the bag that are subject to shock \n \nInsertrolley Compatible \nThis bag is compatible with the Kata Insertrolley (KT VG-DTS, sold separately) - a simple yet ingenious system that allows you to carry the case, or even several cases at once, on a trolley. Simply slide the trolley through the integrated sleeve on any of Kata's compatible cases for secure and easy mobility. Even for larger cases - Kata's extendable wheel system helps to provide better stabilization. You can detach the trolley when you want to store it, or for maintenance \n \nRain Cover \nThe provided rain cover will protect your valuable equipment during extreme weather conditions \n \nAeriform Foam \nFor a unique combination of lightweight and protective material, Kata developed the Aeriform Foam. It's a perforated, laminated and reinforced foam of EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate) and EPE (polyethylene) materials. The result is superlight foam that keeps your gear protected \n \nCarry-On Form Factor \nFAA and airline carry-on specifications are subject to change without notice, please check with your airline before designating this case as a carry-on item. Most airlines require carry-on items to have an external linear measurement that is equal to or less than 45.0\" (114.3 cm). The external dimensions of this case add up to 42.9\" (109.0 cm)    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_clKomsBeAFb_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_l1LDHuZNUcw_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_hImVvV2Dy7h_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00303_lWMZpaoBx1L_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01010_7pMMhuKXy0E_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01414_2bupNfg3TYr_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_4qUsFX17B3s_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00101_hY0Z7G8YScv_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00000_7q5tpnuCy78_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "38.443200", "lng": "-122.754700", "postId": "5950294712", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/nby/for/5950294712.html", "postDate": "2017-01-07T23:32:35-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-09T20:47:27-0800", "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/for/5950294712", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:52:16.423132", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

It is a vintage Japanese retail product, likely ca. 1970s. It comes in its original blister pack, removed only for listing photos. The NA-CORD is unique in its shape, a flexible representation of a fish-type skeleton. It harkens to early cartoon portrayal of the shocking effect of electricity. This skeletal creature is about 4 feet long. It has a two-prong plug at the tail to insert into a wall outlet, and a simplex outlet at its head (skull) in which to plug-in another electrical device --your laptop, your iPad, etc. The eyes of the skeleton glow orange when skeleton is surging with power. The cord is rated for use with 125v 12A electrical service, compatible with standard US household service.

{"title": "The  Torch wifi \"nanny\"", "price": "90", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "willow glen / cambrian", "description": "\n         \nNot sure how to describe this so I call it a \"wifi interrupter\". It's similar to the Circle by Disney and is a device you attach to your modem that enables you, very easily from an app on your phone, to control the wifi going to each and every device you set up.  You can block specific sites, genres of sites (i.e. gambling, online games) or flat out shut off wifi to a particular device without shutting down your ipad in the process. \n \nKid on Xbox Live too much? Shut it down or set specific time limits for Xbox without having to pull the wifi plug on every other device in the house (who hasn't changed the wifi password or unplugged wifi out of frustration then had to go back and log in each. and. every. device. again.?) \n \nWant to block homework kids from games and social media during homework time but not shut the toddler off from the ipad? With Torch you can set up profiles for, and control, each device individually. Or, want to shut everyone off during dinner? You can do that with one tap, all at once. \n \nMy own two cents is this it worth it for the arguments it stops; the whining that goes along with \"turn off Minecraft, NOW\". It just shuts them down when the specified time comes.  Furthermore, you'll never giggle more than when you say to your kids \"if you hit your brother one more time and I'm turning off your wifi\", and then...you touch a button on the app and BOOM, no more wifi!  \n \nSo...if it's so great, why am I getting rid of it? Well..... \n \nI bought this during a Kickstarter campaign almost 2 years ago but it took longer to ship than expected so I broke down and bought the Circle instead. Now I don't need the Torch, though I think it's probably more robust than Circle. I just don't have the patience to get used to a new platform, even though setup for both is easy-peasy. \n \nVisit mytorch.com to learn more about the setup and check the pics to see what it looks like and some of the features.

It's compatible with Mac computers, PCs, and wireless devices such as iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch that use 802.11a, 802.11b, or 802.11g technologies. \n \nMac + PC \nAdditionally, some Wi-Fi devices use the 2.4 GHz wireless band (such as the iPhone, iPod touch, and other devices using 802.11b/g). And other devices can use both the 2.4 GHz spectrum as well as the higher speed 5 GHz spectrum--such as 802.11n-based Mac computers and Apple TV. \n \nThe Airport Extreme operates simultaneously on both bands, without you having to choose one spectrum over the other--enabling your Wi-Fi devices to receive optimal performance in speed and range. Plus, devices that can connect to the Airport Extreme on either band will automatically use the best available band. \n \nSee how the Airport Extreme delivers fast wireless networking to any home or small business. \n \nGigabit Ethernet \n \nIn addition to Wi-Fi networking, the AirPort Extreme Base Station includes three Gigabit Ethernet ports for fast wired connectivity with desktop computers, network drives, and more.

Check it out for yourself to see the saving you get with this system. \n \n \nHigh Definition Picture Quality: \n \nSony's HD CMOS image sensor provides excellent picture quality at HD resolution (1280 x 720 pixels) in 16:9 aspect ratio. The full potential of sharp, clear HD images is ensured thanks to XDNR noise reduction and visibility enhancer systems. \n \nImproved performance in challenging lighting conditions: \n \nSony's Visibility Enhancer technology improves performance in challenging lighting conditions, for example high-contrast environments, such as casinos and highways, that had previously been difficult to monitor. The Visibility Enhancer's advanced system suppresses extreme whites and boosts dark areas in a scene simultaneously and dynamically, to produce clearer images on the screen. \n \nClear low-light images: \n \nXDNR (Excellent Dynamic Noise Reduction) technology virtually eliminates image blur in low-light conditions, enabling users to clearly capture images that have not been easy to portray in the past. It also overcomes the problems associated with many competitor camera models. What's more, when both XDNR and Visibility Enhancer are turned on, the cameras can achieve four times the sensitivity compared to when they are off. This technology is ideal for any outdoor surveillance monitoring, such as in a car park at night. \n \nPowerful optical zoom: \n \n10x high quality optical zoom delivers greater flexibility in finding and tracking targets. \n \nWider vertical viewing range: \n \nA 210\u00b0 tilt angle allows a wider vertical viewing range, whilst 400\u00b0/sec pan/tilt speed and 360\u00b0 continuous rotation allows users to find and track targets quickly and easily. The E-flip feature provides seamless viewing through the full tilt swing. \n \nQuick Release Mechanism: \n \nA new base design, incorporating a Quick Release Mechanism, makes installation and servicing faster and easier. \n \nHigh Power over Ethernet capability (IEEE802.3at): \n \nSupporting high Power over Ethernet (hPoE), the SNC-RH Series can be powered using the same Ethernet cable it uses for data transfer. This feature greatly reduces the physical infrastructure costs and speed of deployment. (Available with version 1.2 or later software.) \n \nTriple Codec Network Operation: \n \nThis multi-codec camera supports three compression formats: JPEG, the best choice of high-quality still images \n \nONVIF Compliant: \n \nThe ONVIF (Open Network Video Interface Forum) defines a common protocol for the exchange of information between network video devices including automatic device discovery, video streaming and intelligence metadata. Allows interoperability between network video devices. \n \nTamper Alarm: \n \nWhen an attempt is made to tamper with the camera, such as spray-painting the lens, the SNC-RH Series detects this and triggers an alarm. This event can also be used to activate the camera relays, or even to start the Voice Alert function. \n \nAdvanced Audio Detection: \n \nUnlike conventional audio detection where an alarm is triggered based on a preset audio level, the SNC-RH Series triggers its alarms based on ambient sound conditions as the threshold. The camera stores and updates ambient audio levels and frequencies, and when the threshold level based on this data, is surpassed, an alarm is triggered. (Available with version 1.1 or later software.) \n \nAudio Message Alert: \n \nThe camera can store up to three pre-recorded audio alert messages which may be played via an active speaker upon manual or automatic initiation. \n \nAudio Echo Cancellation: \n \nThis feature removes the echo frequently encountered between the operator and remote site audio systems when speakers and microphones are used. \n \nLocal Storage / Wireless Capability \n \nThe SNC-RH Series has a Compact Flash (CF) slot. This can be used either with a CF memory card for local video storage, or for wireless capability. The SNCA-CFW5 (802.11b/g) CF type wireless LAN card is supported. \n \n \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_dvQquB3NEhi_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_hXHOoJ9WiQ6_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_3PY2aDQYI8G_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_eHqhZfHD3dt_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_cw6RRYsVNyS_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_eL5fMmyPZmf_600x450.jpg"], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5947206179", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/ele/5947206179.html", "postDate": "2017-01-05T15:19:21-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-12T09:56:51-0800", "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "medium", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/ele/5947206179", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:52:40.064845", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "Tom Bihn Synapse 19 French Blue Condura NW Sky Halcyon 200", "price": "155", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "alameda", "description": "\n         \nWe are selling our Synapse 19 backpack. It has been gently used for less than a year. The only reason we are getting rid of it is because we bought the Synapse 25 (its bigger). We have been using it as a diaper bag and it keeps everything so well organized! Selling for $155 obo.  \n \nInformation from the Tom Bihn Website:  \n \nSPECS: \nDimensions: 16\" x 11.4\" x 7.9\" / 410 x 290 x 200 mm \nWeight:400d  \nHalcyon\u00ae/420d nylon ripstop: 1 lb 7 oz / 650 grams \n1000d Cordura: 1 lb 8 oz / 695 grams \nVolume: 1160 cubic inches / 19 liters (ASTM Standard Measure) \nRemovable 1\" / 25 mm waist strap included \n.375\" / 10 mm padded and contoured backpack straps with .75\" / 20 mm removable sternum strap \nTotal O-rings: 8 (2 in the main compartment; 1 in the top center pocket, 1 in the small center pocket, 2 in the bottom front pocket; 1 in the left front pocket; 1 in the right front pocket \n \nPeople hike, travel, or commute with this versatile pack; where will you take it? \nThe Synapse 19 is a carefully calculated, supremely organized backpack, designed for day hiking, everyday carry, and ultralight travel. Its graceful, curvilinear exterior may on first blush look like something akin to sculpture, but in truth it is simply the judicious realization of ultimate utility. No mesh pockets clutter the exterior of this bag, nor extraneous straps festoon it; in it, you'll be able to carry more than you would imagine, and no one will be the wiser. \n \nThe Synapse 19 is designed to fit people from approximately 5'0\" to 6'0\" / 1.52 to 1.83m; it's the smaller version of our Synapse 25 (for those 5'6\" / 1.68 m or taller or who want a bigger bag -- check it out). With 30% less volume, it's ideal for those of us who just don't need to carry as much stuff. \n \nThe front of the Synapse 19 is divided into five zippered pockets, all of which zip shut with #8 YKK Aquaguard\u00ae water-repellent zippers: \n \nThough you'd never guess by looking at it, the top center front pocket is deep enough for a 1-liter water bottle (our Lifefactory Water Bottles fit -- so should any type of 1-liter or smaller water bottle) or 1-liter hydration bladder. Everyone who has carried a water bottle in a backpack knows how important it is to pack the water bottle wisely so it a) doesn't dig into your back and b) doesn't throw off the weight of the pack. With the water bottle kept in dead center of the Synapse 19, you won't have to worry about either. Removing the water bottle from the Synapse 19 (and replacing it) is a breeze. Note that the water bottle pocket doesn't needlessly continue to the bottom of the bag; that'd be wasted space, plus you'd have to reach farther in to pull your water bottle out. Instead, we took that volume and allocated it to the bottom pocket (where it can serve good instead of evil -- see below). Also worth noting: the water bottle pocket has one O-ring. (Yes, we do listen: we're adding O-rings. Just because you asked.) \n \nBelow the opening for the bottle pocket is another small zippered pocket, also with one O-ring: it's just deep enough for keys, a wallet, glove liners, or a small camera. \n \nThe side pockets are generously sized for sunglasses (in a case or alone), a first aid kit, or even a light Windbreaker-type jacket or down vest compressed in a stuff sack (like our Travel Stuff Sack). The right side pocket has an 200d Halcyon/nylon-lined inner organizational pocket; the left pocket has three pen/pencil slots. Both side zippered pockets feature one O-ring -- one comes with an 8\" / 200 mm Key Strap. \n \nThe bottom front pocket of the Synapse 19 is a great spot for extra clothing or snacks and will easily accommodate a thin wool/fleece sweater, light down jacket and/or Windbreaker-type jacket. If you care to add organization, it's more than big enough for a 3D Organizer Cube (Mesh, Fabric (Halcyon or Parapack), or Clear) or Side Effect; two O-rings are inside this pocket. (Packing advice: tether one of the above-mentioned organizational cubes or Organizer Pouches to the O-rings via a Key Strap.) And because we care about your safety, we've added a 1.5\" / 38 mm webbing loop on the exterior bottom of this pocket that's ready to accept the Guardian Light -- highly recommended if you ride a bicycle or walk in the dark. \n \nThe Synapse 19 has one main, back compartment for large, flat items like notebooks or laptops -- it closes with a #8 YKK Aquaguard\u00ae water-repellent zipper. It has two O-rings for you to attach Organizer Pouches or tether other items. Also inside the main compartment are four unobtrusive webbing loops, two fore and two aft, to which you can secure the optional Cache (available in sizes specifically for every Apple laptop and iPad; PC users, click here to take a look at our Laptop Fit Guide). When you add the Cache, the Synapse 19 becomes a \"checkpoint-friendly\" laptop backpack. Here's how it works: on the back (or bottom, depending how you look at it) of the Cache are two parallel \"rails\" of 1\" wide lightweight nylon webbing which extend from the top to the bottom. Included (and already attached for your convenience) with the Cache are two Gatekeeper Rail Clips: unclip the side that isn't clipped to the Cache, slip it through the webbing loops in the Synapse 19 main compartment, and flip it shut. Slip the Cache inside the Synapse 19, and pull it back out: you'll see that the Gatekeeper Rail Clips ride the rails of the Cache, allowing you to remove your laptop from the Synapse 19 entirely while it is still encased in the protective Cache. Doing this at the airport security checkpoint means the X-ray machines (and TSA personnel) will have a clear, unobstructed view of your laptop -- allowing you to keep your laptop in the Cache and the whole affair securely held together as one unit. (We think that's much better than having to remove your laptop and dump it in one of those buckets.) Many of us will appreciate this functionality on a daily basis as well: the rail system can be a convenient and quick way to remove one's laptop from the bag. And remember, there are four loops of webbing in the top of the main compartment of the Synapse 19: one pair is on the back side, and one pair is on the front side. That means you can choose to have your laptop against your back or against the front of the bag, whichever seems most comfortable or most convenient. Using all four loops, you could even carry two laptops (or one laptop and one iPad) in the Synapse 19. Note that the \"checkpoint-friendly\" functionality will only work for one of two laptops -- you'll need to remove the second laptop at the airport security checkpoint; TSA does not technically consider an iPad or similar tablet a \"laptop,\" but you never know if they'll ask you to remove device #2 anyway. \n \nAlso inside the main compartment is an elastic-topped, open-top pocket. Generously sized to fit a book or two or an extra pair of shoes. The open-top pocket will also fit some sizes of Cache, including the 11\" Air, iPad, and iPad mini sizes. (If you plan to carry a water bottle in the water bottle pocket and also an iPad or other device in the open-top main compartment pocket, make sure the device is protected with a Cache or a similar protective sleeve: the water bottle pocket is directly in front of the open-top pocket and your device is best protected from your hard water bottle.) \n \nThe remainder of the main compartment opens wide -- ready to accept whatever larger items you're packing. \n \nThe Synapse 19 is available with an exterior of 1000 denier Cordura\u00ae or ultralight 400d Halcyon/420d nylon ripstop fabric and an interior of 200 denier Japanese Halcyon/nylon ripstop fabric (see the color-selection drop-down list for which have a Halcyon/nylon exterior). 400d Halcyon/420d nylon ripstop -- a stellar fabric -- is made for us in Japan. Its great tear strength and surprising abrasion resistance comes from the grid of white Halcyon\u00ae yarns woven approximately every .25\u2033 / 6 mm parallel to both the X and Y axes (the weft and warp), forming the distinctive \"ripstop\" pattern (the Halcyon\u00ae yarns don't accept dye and hence remain their natural white color). 1000 denier Cordura\u00ae is a classic pack fabric: durable, abrasion-resistant, and with a rougher canvas-like look and texture many have come to appreciate. \n \nFor the interior of the Synapse 19 we chose 200d Halcyon/nylon because it's ultra-lightweight and ultratough. We've used this fabric for several years now with virtually no complaints or failures; it's been abrasion tested by both our fabric suppliers and our in-house lab. Conclusion? 200d Halcyon/nylon is perhaps a bit of overkill for a lining fabric, and you expect nothing less from us. \n \nThe back panel of the Synapse 19 is padded with 1/4\", high quality, closed-cell foam with an exterior of Dri-Lex\u00ae Aero-Spacer\u00ae mesh and 400 denier nylon. This combination of mesh and smooth nylon is designed to provide maximum breathability while still being gentle on your clothing. The contoured backpack straps of the Synapse were custom designed by Tom to fit folks from 5'6\" to 6'6\" / 1.68 to 1.98 m. We tested the Synapse backpack straps on a wide range of people -- all heights, shapes, and sizes -- and we think we've come up with straps that work for just about anyone: no small feat! The shoulder straps are padded with .375\" / 10 mm EV50 closed-cell foam and feature an underside of ETC knit to keep you cool and comfortable. The Synapse 19 features adjustable and removable sternum and waist straps with leave-no-trace hardware: if you don't like or don't use your waist or sternum strap, remove them and leave (almost) nothing behind (a design inspired by nature). At the top of the back of the pack, you'll find a webbing loop: use it to hoist the Synapse 19 up and onto your back or to hang it on a coat hook. \n \nEnough said. Now get one and get out of here.

{"title": "Innotab 2S + 2 Game Cartridges", "price": "40", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "lower nob hill", "description": "\n         \nInnotab 2S - $40/each.   I had one for each of my 3 kids, but they've outgrown them now.   These were an excellent way to prepare them for school and give them great screen time that was fun AND educational. \n \nVTech InnoTab 2 review \nThe VTech InnoTab 2 is a big improvement on the first model of children's tablet, adding rotating camera, microphone and a raft of new kids' apps, games and content. \n \nVTECH INNOTAB 2 REVIEW \n \nNow VTech has updated its children's tablet with the InnoTab 2, just weeks after Leapfrog's new LeapPad2 hit the shelves. It costs \u00a384.99, and is available in blue or pink models. See InnoTab 2 review. \nREVIEW: WHAT'S NEW ABOUT THE VTECH INNOTAB 2 \nThe InnoTab 2 improves on the original VTech InnoTab in several significant ways. Take a look at the LeapPad 2 vs InnoTab 2 children's tablet comparison review. \nThe most noticeable difference is the built-in 1.3-megapixel camera with a rotating 'self-portrait' lens so children can switch easily between taking a picture of someone or something else and then themselves -- a popular feature of VTech's Kidizoom camera. \nKids can take their own picture, use the editing suite to add special effects to it and then use their photo in various games and apps. \nThe rotating camera feels robust enough to take a mauling. There'll likely be a few mistaken pictures of the user's face until the child (or parent!) gets the hang of it, but it's a neat idea that gets around the problem of taking photos of things and yourself. \n \nOne of the original LeapPad's major benefits over the InnoTab was its camera, even if it was a feeble 0.3-megapixel snapper.  \nWhile children weren't too bothered by the low-resolution camera images, having a decent camera on a kids' tablet means they'll be more interested in taking lots of snaps, and the extra storage capacity also comes into play here. \nThe InnoTab 2's 1.3-megapixel camera is a dash lower quality than the LeapPad2's 2-megaixels but it's ample for what the kids will use it for. And it finally makes the InnoTab a real contender against the LeapPad. \n \nThe VTech InnoTab 2 also features a built-in microphone for enhanced gameplay and video recording. \nChildren love the multimedia features of these tablets, and it's what should differentiate a tablet from other forms of kids' play. \nNothing's better for a child's creative play learning than a pad of paper and some pens and pencils, and parents are rightly wary about merely replacing these with a tablet art app for drawing and colouring in. \nApps and games that truly make use of tablet features such as still/video cameras and microphones are fun activities and skills a child is unlikely to get without some help from kid-friendly technology. \nIt's not just educational, of course. Everything's wrapped up in fun. The Camera app, for instance, lets you add the 'wacky effects' to pictures by clicking on the Wand icon in the top left corner. \nThe InnoTab 2 looks much like the first InnoTab model, with a 5-inch screen, and equipped with video player, art studio, tilt sensor for motion game play, MP3 music player, e-reader, calendar, friends list, and notes app. \nWe like the InnoTab 2's pull-out stand, which means the tablet doesn't have to be held by the child all the time. \nThe InnoTab 2's internal 2GB memory is up from the original version's paltry 128MB, and can be expanded via its built-in SD card memory reader. While the LeapPad 2 has twice the capacity it lacks this opportunity to add external memory. \nEach InnoTab 2 can be personalized for up to four users with photo wallpaper, user name and avatar, a voice greeting and typed greeting. \n \nVTECH INNOTAB 2 REVIEW: GAMES AND APPS \nThe new children's tablet comes with a software cartridge 'Read, Play & Create' featuring three apps: an eBook What's That Noise, colouring art app Colour & Pop, and augmented reality game Alien Rescue. \nAlso pre-installed: Face Race, a motion-sensitive tightrope-walking games; and Art Studio (which you get as soon as you register the device). \nIt also comes with two free games tokens. When you install the VTech Learning Lodge Navigator on your computer you can download two of a large range of games, normally priced around \u00a33. This is also where you buy, download and transfer apps and games (from 99p) to your InnoTab. \nVTech has launched a range of new InnoTab software cartridges (sold separately), including Pixar's latest Brave, Hello Kitty, Thomas & Friends and Jake and the Neverland Pirates. \nVTech InnoTab games cartridges \n \n \nInnoTab 2 Software cartridges have each gaming cartridge coming with an animated e-book, three learning games and two creative activities. \nTo further differentiate it from the Leapfrog offerings VTech has also signed partnership agreements that will give InnoTab owners access to a library of videos of TV programmes, mini e-books and music content. \nThe content, from VTech's online Learning Lodge Navigator boasts hundreds of downloads including TV shows, music and e-books featuring a bunch of children's favourite characters and artists such as Peppa Pig, Wallace & Gromit, Shaun the Sheep and Thomas & Friends, as well as a host of famous artists from the Sony Music catalogue. \nKIDS' TABLET AGE RANGE \nThe VTech InnoTab 2, like the LeapPad2, is aimed at 3-9 year olds. Three-year-olds won't have much problem playing with the tablet, but children over 7 or 8 might find it little toy-like and prefer something more adult. The LeapPad is a little more stylish than the InnoTab, and smaller too, despite also boasting a 5-inch screen. \nAn Apple iPad or iPod touch might suit the older child, or any of the latest 7-inch Android tablets would be suitable. Note, though, that such tablets have access to the wild world of the Internet, and so you should consider proper child-friendly restrictions when left with a young one. \n \nSPECS \nVTech InnoTab 2: Specs \n5-inch screen \n1.3-megapixel camera (rotating, 2GB internal storage, SD card slot. \nVERDICT \nThe VTech InnoTab 2 is sure to be one of the hottest gadget gifts for kids under 8 this Christmas. Its improved specifications, including the new rotating camera and microphone plus increased storage capacity, are excellent upgrades. The software range is wide, although not as great as available for adult tablets like the iPad. Although kids' tablets such as the InnoTab 2 certainly shouldn't replace parent-time or good, old-fashioned pen & paper activities (let alone something a lot more active!) its educational and fun quiet-time benefits should justify the price.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services.

CALL / TEXT: 65O-TWO-9O-TWO-397  TOP CASH PAIDHayden Separator Antique Shop A Very Merry CHRISTMAS to You All! 2nd Annual Christmas Present Special With each purchase over $50.00-$99.99 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in red paper. With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you.

Heated, cooled and advertised all under one business, Blue Moon. Most Unique Gifts for Dad or Grand Dads......... I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W. ANY OF MY NEWSPAPERS OR MAGAZINES may be inspected (AT THE COUNTER) after you pay for them.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you.

Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms.

Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W.

CALL / TEXT: 65O-TWO-9O-TWO-397  TOP CASH PAID Hayden Separator Antique Shop A Very Merry CHRISTMAS to You All! 2nd Annual Christmas Present Special With each purchase over $50.00-$99.99 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in red paper. With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you.

Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W. ANY OF MY NEWSPAPERS OR MAGAZINES may be inspected (AT THE COUNTER) after you pay for them.

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you. A very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all of you!\n\n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5957305584", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/wad/5957305584.html", "postDate": "2017-01-13T04:28:05-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "low", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5957305584", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:53:05.720452", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W. ANY OF MY NEWSPAPERS OR MAGAZINES may be inspected (AT THE COUNTER) after you pay for them. You will clearly see they are complete and authentic\n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5957357459", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/wad/5957357459.html", "postDate": "2017-01-13T05:39:03-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "low", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5957357459", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:53:06.207001", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

With each purchase over $100.00 (before taxes), you will receive any antique Christmas present you chose from under our Christmas tree that is wrapped in green paper. Each gift is something I randomly pick from our antique shop to wrap and put under our tree. The gift's value is about 1/4+ of the required purchase amount. I chose treasures that I think people who like rustic antiques might like to have. Also, in addition to our annual Christmas Present Special, I've decided to give out blue or red gift bags for purchases from $5.00 through $49.99 (before taxes). These are not antiques or extravagant gifts but just something to say thank you for your business and may you have a Very Merry Christmas. The Christmas season is our most favorite time of the year. If the word \"Christmas\" offends anyone, we don't really care! I can't imagine being \"offended\" by the names of anyone else's holiday. For those of you who are not offended or just don't care, why don't you come visit our festively decorated shop. Window shoppers/browsers are also always welcome -no purchase necessary. Just come and take a look around our 9 room shop and see if we can get you into the Christmas spirit while sipping on complementary hot cider, wassail, coffee, tea or cocoa. Our shop consists of 3 rooms full of primitive/rustic antiques, 1 room with higher end antiques, 2 rooms with more common antiques and 3 rooms stocked with flea market/garage sale type items. We are also selling cranberries at $2.00 per pound. In our Cranberry Room, we recently set up our full antique legendary Hayden sorting line which consist of our blower, elevator, separator and front sorting trays. Watch as our cranberries are sorted the same way as they were over 100 years ago. Our antique shop is located in a former cranberry screen house which was called \"The New England Cranberry Sales Company\" (built in 1918) where the same process took place over 90 years. Before visiting us, we strongly suggest that you call, text or email us ahead of time to avoid disappointment just in case something comes up and we cannot be here to greet you. Hours: Monday - Friday 12 noon - 6 PM Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Sunday 12 noon - 4 PM We except all major credit cards and cash of course. But no checks of any type -- sorry. Hayden Separator Antique Shop Hayden Mfg. Co. Inc. 70 Carver Rd. W. Wareham MA We are proudly celebrating 124 years in our family business supplying the cranberry industry with goods and services. This is our 10th year in the antique business. We are an accredited business and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. **Please note to dress warm as we only have heat in two of our rooms. We are looking forward meeting you and sharing the history of our family business with you. A very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all of you!\n\n    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5957304130", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/wad/5957304130.html", "postDate": "2017-01-13T04:25:27-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "low", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/wad/5957304130", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:53:06.344056", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

Unlike audio recording, MIDI lets you capture the digital instructions for a musical performance, and then play them back later on a MIDI instrument. \n \nIn one compact device for your iPad, StudioConnect combines both the audio and the MIDI hemispheres of the audio world. \n \nAudio In and Out \n \nPlug your external instrument into StudioConnect's mono 1/4\" instrument jack and play directly into iOS DAW or other apps. \n \nPlug a recorder or mixer into StudioConnect's stereo 3.5 mm input jack and connect the whole band to your iPad. \nLeft- and right-channel RCA plugs give you line-level stereo audio-out. \nFor your headphones, there's a separate front-panel 3.5 mm stereo jack with its own volume knob. \nMIDI In and Out \nFor your MIDI controller or drum pad, StudioConnect's rear panel gives you a standard 5-pin DIN MIDI-in port. \n \nFor MIDI Out, there's another 5-pin DIN MIDI connector on StudioConnect's rear panel. Connect it to your sequencer, patch bay, or other MIDI gear. This lets you launch your favorite MIDI controller app and use your iPad as a musical instrument. \n \nStudioConnect lets you connect everything for music-making to your iPad, and connect your iPad to everything musical. And as if that weren't enough, it even charges your iPad while you play. \n \nPrice: $49    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_51ulUmxZMjM_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_59uDYkIf097_600x450.jpg"], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5935972304", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/msg/5935972304.html", "postDate": "2016-12-28T08:54:42-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-09T17:40:52-0800", "attributes": "like new Griffin StudioConnect w/Lightning 7.9\" x 5.5\" x 1.6\"", "locAccuracy": "medium", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/msg/5935972304", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 07:53:18.349387", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "MMA=Multi Billion $ Sport with 1 Pro Team. We Build 2nd Team to be #1", "price": "1", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "campbell", "description": "\n         \nThe UFC generated a gross of \"Over 2 Billion\" in 2015 according to CNBC and research. They can generate 30-40MM with each PPV event. Those numbers represent USA PPV and the gate only, not international earnings. Plus they have several TV shows and other income streams. \n They were also just bought by IME for 4.2 BILLION and are in a transitional stage and its uncertain how things will go for them. With the very problematic current state of affairs of their organization and an acquisition this year I feel puts us in a position to take advantage of the turmoil they are experiencing (there are many, many problems within the promotion). In my opinion MMA at the top level is run with incompetence and arrogance. This is the perfect opportunity for a 2nd team to enter the game, take advantage of the opportunity and become #1. I have spent years compiling data, ideas and strategic plans to build a superior and extremely successful MMA team. \n The UFC is the ONLY Pro MMA Team! This sport needs a 2nd team. Well managed and professionally handled. One that will recognize the fighters need for much better pay and the fans need for at least 1 sport to be the real deal and more exciting. \n \n (((THIS IS A HUGE MONEY, FAST GROWING, ALL YEAR LONG, WORLD WIDE MEGA SPORT THAT INVOLVES BOTH SEXES, IS PPV'S BIGGEST SELLER, HAS ONLY 1 TOP COMPETITOR AND IT HAS NOT MADE PRO STATUS YET.))) Did you catch that? Please read it again. THIS IS A GIFT!!! \n \n I have the plans and ideas to make it extremely successful however I lack the experience and knowledge to build it. \n What I need is a partner or partners with experience in building and running a team. I need good people with good attitudes that are team players. Big League and/or TV / PPV experience is a plus. \n From investors I would figure a 15-30 Million Dollar Investment to be safe. Could be less. I read the UFC gets 100K plus for each 30 second commercial on their fox TV shows. That's 4+ Million for \"each\" 1 hr show and 30+ Million per PPV event. This would indicate a fast return on solid, multiple and monthly income streams. \n Billions are waiting for us. There's a perfect opportunity right now to do this. The fighters are disgusted with the low pay and poor treatment. What do you think will happen when we offer great pay and a much better home? \n >>>>> Please Leave a Message Stating How You Can Help Build This Promotion. <<<<< \n Please No More of \"I Know a Guy\".

Here's a quick list of the specifications for it: \n \n-MacOSX Sierra  \n-Retina display: 15.4-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit display with IPS technology; 2880-by-1800 resolution at 220 pixels per inch with support for millions of colors \n-2.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz) with 6MB shared L3 cache \n-8GB of 1600MHz DDR3L onboard memory \n-256GB Harddrive \n-Intel HD Graphics 4000 \n-NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M with 1GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching \n-MagSafe 2 power port \n-Two Thunderbolt ports (up to 10 Gbps) \n-Two USB 3 ports (up to 5 Gbps) \n-HDMI port \n-Headphone port \n-SDXC card slot \n-802.11n Wi-Fi wireless networking;3 IEEE 802.11a/b/g compatible \n-Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technology \n-Stereo speakers \n-Dual microphones \n-Full-size backlit keyboard with 78 (U.S.) or 79 (ISO) keys, including 12 function keys and 4 arrow keys (inverted \"T\" arrangement) with ambient light sensor \n-Multi-Touch trackpad for precise cursor control; supports inertial scrolling, pinch, rotate, swipe, three-finger swipe, four-finger swipe, tap, double-tap, and drag capabilities \n \nFor any other questions about the specifications, you can find them at the Apple page here: https://support.apple.com/kb/sp653?locale=en_US \n \nI have always kept the laptop in a hard shell case which will come with it. The hard shell case is a little beat up and due to some dust and other things getting in it, the bottom of the MacBook Pro does have some minor scratches on it. However, the inside and top of the MacBook Pro are perfect and show no signs of wear. I've only ever used the laptop for photography work and have just recently upgraded to a desktop so I'm looking to sell my Macbook Pro.  \n \nThe laptop comes with a brand new charger that was bought very recently for it. I also have the original box and manuals for it too. \n \nI'm asking $700 firm for everything and will not go any lower so please do not ask. I'm also not interested in any trades so again, please don't ask. \n \nI'm actually located in Sacramento, but for anyone coming from the Bay Area, I'm willing to meet in Vacaville, but no farther than that. And we'll meet at a local Starbucks so that you can test the wifi and anything else you'd like on it.  \n \nSo, If you've got $700 cash in hand and are willing to drive to me and meet in person, then please feel free to email me or, preferably, text me at 916-Eight-Three-Three-9530. Thanks and have a nice day!

Here is its history report...When I bought the bike the previous owner had a 01 drz400E motor professionally rebuilt to OEM specifications then installed.. the motor has roughly 1500 miles on full rebuild. The previous owner also provided me the complete origanl motor to show that he did under go a motor swap. I ended up parting out the origanl motor but holding on to the crank case to show that it was all a legit engine swap to match numbers.\n \nThis bike is done right with all the necessary modifications to make it run its best, while also being 100% reliable. This bike has no issues at all and runs top notch, I've taken great care of this bike as I do with all my toys I have. Keeping up on a good maintenance schedule is key for these kind of bikes (or any bike) oil/filter changed every 800-1k miles along with cleaning the air filter and checking the valves. These kind of bike will go for 50k+ if you take care of them with a good maintenance schedule. As for the origanl owner who sold it to the previous owner, he did not keep on good maintenance schedule (ran it with low oil) and that resulted in head failure that ended up seizing top end on the origanl motor. Thats is the reason why the previous owner under went a full engine swap. The previous owner had connection with a good low mile drz400E motor so he figured he'd just do a full rebuild to that one instead due to the E motors having more efficient carburetors and also have more efficient cams gears, the only other differences between the motors (S & SM's) are the base gaskets and that the E motor does not have a neutral light wire plug. \n \nThis bike has a bunch of aftermarket parts along with a custom one off exhaust system and the battery being professionally relocated.

{"title": "New YAMAHA TF1 32 channel digital mixer", "price": "1799", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "san mateo", "description": "\n         \nTF1 is the easiest digital mixer to work on, even untrained church volunteers can mix on it after brief introduction! 36 inputs to mix, 20 onboard inputs, 16 onboard mic preamps (same recallable preamps as in QL/CL series), 16 outputs (freely assignable as mains, subgroups, monitor mixes, etc.).  \n \nMixer is NEW,  was bought it for a church project who decided to go with the larger Yamaha QL5  (a $12K desk) at the last moment, so this TF1 is for sale now. You can register it with Yamaha and get full warranty from day one. Firmware was upgraded to the latest v.3.01, the newest and cleanest TF1 money can buy. \n \nMy price is more than reasonable: they are $2000-plus elsewhere, and there's hardly any used TF1's on the market now -- people just not selling them! Google \"Yamaha TF1\", you'd be surprised by for how much it sells even online! So your only option will be either to get a new one at full retail, or to get mine in the same new condition for at least $500 less. \n \nChannel structure is similar to well-known Yamaha 01v96 mixer: first input layer (1-16) is coming from onboard inputs (combo XLR-TRS jacks), second (17-32) is either USB or card inputs and outputs. Actually it has 20 onboard inputs, counting two pairs of stereo ins: you can use those for keyboards or drums submixes, or USB playback, leaving the rest for mono sources like mics and guitars. You can mix a typical 4-5 piece band on TF1 just fine, without any add-ons (most bands fit into 16 channels or less). \n \nYou don't really need a snake with this mixer: leave it on stage, plug everything in and let musicians control their own monitor mixes right there, while sound guy can mix the FOH from anywhere in audience using iPad or laptop. \n \nTF1 allows individual per-channel input routing, not in blocks of 8 like X32/M32. Very convenient if you are using backing tracks from DAW during live performance: you can have 16-20 \"live\" inputs coming from stage combined with up to 34 DAW tracks (or any combination thereof).  If using Dante card input, you can have any Dante-compatible stage box feeding all 32 inputs from stage if desired (I doubt if it will be needed, realistically most 4-5 piece bands can fit into 16 channels or less). Dante is an audio communication protocol that allows up to 64 channels to be transmitted via single thin CAT5 Ethernet cable (pretty much a phone cord). Every respectable console manufacturer has Dante-compatible stage boxes, so you can use it with Soundcraft, MIDAS, Allen and Heath, Focusrite RedNet, they are all compatible. \n \nNice feature is \"Sub\" bus. It's actually a third main bus (what others call \"mono\" or \"center\", you can use it that way), but the most important is that it has a LPF (low-pass filter), thus eliminating the need for crossover. Having separate \"subwoofer\" bus allows to route there only bass instruments (kick drum, bass guitar, bass synth), rather than filtering full mix, thus making low end tight, punchy and not muddy when using just a crossover. \n \nMixer also works as a full-featured 34x34 USB audio interface (34 tracks can be simultaneously recorded and played back from DAW via single USB cable!). Allows you to have full multi-track recording of your performance (not just two-channel stereo), where every input will be recorded on a separate track and later finished in the studio.  \n \nIt's also a great recording console for home or project studios. Can be used with any DAW: Pro Tools, Logic, Cubase, Nuendo, Reaper, to name a few, with more flexibility and better preamps than in older \"studio\" desks such as 01v96, DM1000, 02r96, DM2000, etc. Even if you have no experience with DAWs, you can download free Waves Tracks or Reaper, capture your performance and just give files to someone who can finish them up in Pro Tools. \n \nWhat makes it special -- no surprise -- is the sound. Decades of research and development that made Yamaha digital consoles a standard in pro sound, all it shines in TF desks. And what makes it so easy to use are two things: a MULTI-TOUCH display (yes, you can scroll, pinch, zoom, tap, move virtual sliders just like on iPad. None of other digital mixers can do that, even Yamaha's own CL, QL and PM10! (those have touch screens but only single-touch, means you can select the parameter on the touch screen but can't turn, move, drag, pinch, zoom and do any of multi-touch gestures what TF desks can do). Second is Yamaha's patented \"1-knob\" approach to everything, lets you dial that perfect EQ, compressor, effect with one knob only, using Yamaha's preset algorithms (although you can have full control over all parameters such as gain, frequency, Q (bandwidth), threshold, attack, release, etc.) \n \nIt's the easiest desk for monitor mixing: has no less than 20 (twenty!) monitor mixes, last six are stereo mixes for in-ears. Seriously, you can have 8 floor wedge monitors for choir plus six stereo in-ears for band musicians, all mixed independently. (The next desks in Yamaha lineup with that many monitor mixes are $20K-plus (even used) PM5D and CL series). All auxes can be stereo-linked, giving you 10 STEREO in-ear monitor mixes, more than plenty for a typical band or church service. (None of competitors can do that). All auxes work in sends-on-faders mode, and up to 10 iOS devices (iPhones or iPads) can be used as personal monitor mixers by musicians. In fact you are getting a full functionality of an Aviom personal monitor mixers for free and without 16-channel limitation of Aviom! \n \nAnother feature that makes soundman's  life easy is on-screen RTA (Real-Time Analyzer). You see the whole audio spectrum right on the screen, overlaying EQ. Typical task of eliminating feedback with graphic EQ is a piece of cake: just look at the screen where the offending peak is and simply pull down the corresponding slider, right on screen too. You don't need to have a \"golden ears\" of a seasoned sound engineer or even know what that frequency it is: TF1 does it for you! All 8 wedge monitor outputs already have GEQs assigned to them, no need to route or mount anything. \n \nHere's a very detailed review from FOH magazine: \n \n\"For years, Yamaha's digital mixers seem to set a standard by which other consoles are judged. There is no question that the PM1D, PM5D and M7CL are legendary consoles that defined their respective time periods and market segments. The CL and QL series consoles are no exception, and the PM10 Rivage is poised to be another staple of large-scale productions, much like its predecessor the PM1D. \n \nIn the high-end of the digital console market, there are a plethora of exceptional consoles that are worthy of their price tags. The top of the line consoles are so feature-rich and sound so amazing that it's almost difficult to be wowed by them anymore. What has impressed me over the last few years has not been in the high end of the market, but at the lower end of the price spectrum. \n \nEnter the TF series of consoles. Based on Yamaha's TouchFlow technology, the TF series are truly one of-a-kind consoles that only Yamaha could deliver at this price point! Drawing on almost 30 years of digital console R&D and manufacturing experience, the TF series has something for everyone, from working musicians running their own sound, to the seasoned engineer needing an affordable, compact and feature-rich console. The TF line is clearly aimed at an underserved but growing market of users who require the flexibility and power of a digital console at an affordable price. But don't let its target market fool you, the TF series is packed with features often found on consoles costing four times as much. \n \nUnder each input channel's scribble strip is a bright and colorful strip used to color-code channels into logical groupings. The scribble strip itself is also very large and high resolution. Once the TF fully booted for the first time, a tutorial appeared on the multi-touch screen that gave a rundown on some of the main features and console workflows. In typical fashion, I wanted to close the tutorial and dive right in, but I resisted the urge and powered through it, and it was actually very helpful. \n \nAs I started to move my way around the surface, I really appreciated the layout and ergonomics, long one of Yamaha's strong suit. The multi-touch screen is responsive, and the GUI elements are just the right size for touch operation. While the screen is more than bright enough for indoor operation, it won't be bright enough outdoors, so break out the cardboard sunhood that you've fashioned for your other digital consoles. The buttons have a nice click that provides tactile feedback, and the knobs have an incremental click offering a feeling of precision control. The faders felt fairly smooth, although the fader caps themselves look and feel a bit cheap. For a console at this price point, I can't complain about the overall aesthetics. As I finished my cursory overview of the surface, I found a nice resting place for an iPad to run Yamaha's TF StageMix application. \n \nWorking my way down the input channel strip, I found a layout familiar to any Yamaha user; the head amp, a 4-band EQ + high pass filter, a compressor, a gate and routing section. However, there were a few unique features that were jumping out at me. \n \nEntering the head amp section of the TF, I found a distinctive graphical level display that Yamaha calls \"GainFinder.\" In an attempt to make setting gain structure more intuitive, there is a 5-segment horizontal meter, the center bar of which is a large green indicator denoting \"ideal\" gain structure. This is coupled with a more traditional vertical meter to the right, providing excellent visual feedback about the gain setting for each input. \n \nSecond, the multi-touch screen is excellent for dealing with the input equalizers. The multi-touch screen was very responsive, but is admittedly not for everyone. Some engineers prefer the precision of a knob, so Yamaha has included a \"touch and turn\" knob below the lower right corner of the display, as well as four totally programmable user-defined knobs below the screen. What really caught my eye in the EQ section was a unique function called \"1-knob.\" The EQ section can be operated in the traditional style, with complete control over the parameters of each filter, or you can switch to \"1-knob.\" \n \nThe 1-knob mode has two different settings; Intensity and Vocal. The Intensity mode is the default, which varies the gains of the filters you already have in place. For example, let's say on your kick drum you've got a 6 dB boost at 70 Hz, and a 6 dB cut at 300 Hz. When you engage 1-knob and start to apply it, it will boost your 60 Hz filter even more, and cut your 300 Hz filter further as well. It seems to only modify the gain of filters you already have engaged, and doesn't touch the frequency or Q, hence the name \"Intensity.\" If you switch to the Vocal 1-knob mode, the first thing that happens is the EQ is flattened. As you dial up 1-knob in Vocal mode, it applies varying degrees of \"typical\" vocal equalization that will feel familiar to any experienced engineer. \n \nThe input channels also include a wealth of presets available to help speed up the EQ workflow. These aren't just generic kick, snare, bass, guitar and vocal presets, but rather a well-thought-out set of presets that are specific to many instrument and microphone combinations. Yamaha developed these equalizer presets in conjunction with Shure, Sennheiser and Audio-Technica, as well as a host of respected sound engineers with decades of mixing experience. \n \nSpeaking of presets, a full complement of onboard Yamaha effects are available, including an assortment of reverbs, mono/stereo delays, echo, flange, phaser and multiband compressors, derived from its larger siblings: CL, QL and the newest PM-10. \n \nAll TF consoles have a generous eight mono and six stereo auxes, and the mono auxes can be linked as stereo pairs if necessary. What is really striking is the TF's emphasis on the \"Sends on Fader\" workflow for monitor mixing. As with most digital consoles, the TF provides several ways to do virtually everything, but console design promotes the use of \"Sends on Faders\" as the best method for mixing monitors. The right edge of the console has an entire panel of buttons devoted to this feature, so every mix is immediately available with a single button press. \n \nWhile sends on faders has been given a prominent place on the TF's surface, it doesn't quite tell the whole story. All TF models include the ability to have up to ten iOS devices controlling aux sends, using Yamaha's MonitorMix application. Couple that with up to three additional devices running TF StageMix or TF Editor, and even a large band can have independent control of their monitor mixes, reducing the demands placed on the engineer. \n \nOther Features: It's worth pointing out that I didn't touch the user manual once in this entire process, and I never felt I needed it because the console was so intuitive. It did take me a few minutes to find the eight DCA's, but once I discovered them, I found them easy to program, and they have an automatic \"rollout\" (or \"DCA Spill\") feature that spills channels assigned to the selected DCA across the surface. I could easily mix an entire show just from the DCA bank because of the rollout feature, but Yamaha has also included a custom user bank where you can include any combination of inputs, output masters or DCA's. \n \nI also discovered three small but ingenious buttons across the surface. First, a dedicated \"Tap\" button for tapping delay tempos. No, not a button that can be programmed as a tap tempo, but a button that actually says \"Tap\" on it, and flashes in sync with the current tempo. In the upper right of the console surface, I found two mute buttons labeled \"Input\" and \"FX.\" Essentially preprogrammed mute groups, these buttons are dedicated to the two most common mute group applications; muting all inputs, and muting all effects. Brilliant! Finally, for those who need the more traditional Yamaha \"User Defined Keys,\" those exist as well, directly to the right of the multi-touch display. \n \nA free download from Yamaha's website, TF Editor is a computer program that lets users use a PC to edit TF series console settings while away from the console in offline mode or -- in an online mode-- operate the console via the computer while it's connected to the console.  \n \nAll features are great, but the sound of the console is critical. Using some industry standard Shure and E-V mics, along with pre-recorded tracks, I quickly established gain structure on both microphones and my tracks using the GainFinder feature. Based on Yamaha's D-PRE mic amps, console's recallable (yet discrete-design) preamps were transparent sounding and true to both voice and the mics. Yamaha's documentation states the preamp was \"painstakingly designed with a flat, wide frequency response that retains the tone and nuance of the original sound,\" and what I heard lives up to their description. Apparently it uses several discrete circuits, as you raise the gain you hear two distinct relay clicks (similar to old M7CL), when preamp switches from lower gain to higher gain circuit. \n \nThe EQ's felt responsive as well, and I was able to discern even the slightest change, whereas on some consoles I feel like I have to cut 3 dB or more before hearing any appreciable change in tone. I also tested out the 1-Knob EQ in Vocal mode on the SM58 channel, and it performed just as I expected; a typical vocal response curve, with a dip in the low-mids to compensate for proximity effect, and a slight rise in the high-mids to add some presence. This gets you there (or close to it) fast, which can really come in handy in a live environment \n \nConclusion: I found the TF series to be one of the most compelling digital consoles I've used in the last few years. The features contained in the TF desks would have cost upwards of $20,000 just five years ago, so the fact that these consoles sit in the sub-$5,000 market is truly astonishing. The console is the perfect blend of musician friendly ease-of-use and professional level control. It will be difficult for any other company to top what Yamaha has done with these consoles.\" \n \nSince you see this ad now, it means that mixer is STILL AVAILABLE. Emails asking that stupid question (or \"Do you still have it?\") will be treated as scam and ignored, you won't get a reply.  \n \nCan be seen in San Mateo pretty much any day before 7.30pm., or in Sunnyvale after 8pm. I have all that's needed to test it (mics, speakers, etc), and it's under full factory warranty anyway.

{"title": "2006 Suzuki DRZ400SM", "price": "4000", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "scotts valley", "description": "\n         \nHello everyone, \n \nUp for sale is my 2006 Suzuki DRZ400SM. I recently bought a new bike and now my DRZ doesn't get ridden. I would rather have someone riding it and having fun, then have it sit in my garage. The bike is very clean and ready to go. Everything works, the bike is turn-key and needs nothing. If you're looking for a clean DRZ just to hop on and ride (unlike most that will need work) this would be a great bike. All of the registration and maintenance is up to date. Both tires were just recently replaced and have about 90% tread. I had a gold DID chain put on awhile back that is in very good condition, has at least another 10k miles on it. The brake pads also have plenty of life left in them (you can see the tire and brake pad meat on one of the pictures). Valves were adjusted in the last 2000 miles; so they won't need to be touched for another 15k miles at least. I do a full synthetic oil change every 1000 miles (even though the DRZ can go 3000 miles). The fork seals were done in the past year and won't need to be worried about for awhile. \n \nUpgrades: \nFull MRD exhaust, 3x3 mod, rejetted carb, pro taper evo bars, hel steel braided brake lines, IMS pro mx pegs, sumo front fender, and white spoke skins. I also have two sprockets; one smaller one for commuting and one larger for more bottom torque. My whole point when upgrading this bike was to do all the best power mods without screwing up with the DRZ's amazing reliability. The bike starts up perfectly every time. Bike has never quit on me or left me stranded. \n \nIf interested please feel free to call/text/email me. I will not spend all day answering questions over text or email. I will only consider you serious if you call or come see the bike in person. Please don't waste either of our times. I'm in no rush to sell so no low-ballers and also not interested in trades. Thanks for looking! \n \nTags: drz, drz400, drz400s, sm, 400, 450, 650, 250, 600, Suzuki, Yamaha, Honda, Kawasaki, supermoto, motard, sumo, dr, crf, crf450, wr, wr250, wr450, kx, street legal, plated, dual, sport,    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00606_kbCUlsSzYNf_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00606_ccBSf9bLuAv_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_i1G3dfeFPAO_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_45a2kTjV1iZ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_jkkdFkzXVNa_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00h0h_6xmSh2IV2H3_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_iq4WWFOCPdx_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_k8UYjaDqGLb_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00S0S_6nqhurw6RhN_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00303_dq6DsX0ej8m_600x450.jpg"], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5956808003", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/scz/mcy/5956808003.html", "postDate": "2017-01-12T15:11:12-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "2006 Suzuki DRZ400SM excellent 400 gas 13000 black clean manual", "locAccuracy": "medium", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/mcy/5956808003", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:12.533956", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "2007 E90 BMW 335i 430hp/560tq (over 16k in upgrades)", "price": "19000", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "los gatos", "description": "\n         \nI am un-enthusiastically putting my 2007 BMW 335i up for sale. First off, I must say that I am in no rush whatsoever to sell her. I am only putting her on the market because I now have a Corvette Z06 and am thinking of using my truck to commute. I am sure if you have come to this post, you know there must be something special about this car, since due to miles and the year, the KBB is much below what I am asking. This brings up my second point. If I am to sell this car, it will go to a very lucky buyer. When I purchased the car one year ago (December 2015), I went for the \"great deal\" on the 335i which I went out the door for $17,500 with 70K miles on the car (Included a couple packages still ongoing, listed below). Yes, I have done a lot of performance and cosmetic upgrades, but the main reason the value is so high to me, is that all of the common issues that happen between 60-120k miles have been serviced. I wanted this car to last a long time, and run very smoothly. Below you can see the modifications that have been done on the car. At the bottom I will put the cost of all parts I have invested in, and then the associated labor costs. Finally, there will be a cost total on top of what I paid for the car, and you can see the value that is here. If you want to find a \"cheap 335i\" then I suggest you look for one of the $9-12k ones, but let me tell you. . .YOU WILL NEED TO DO ALL OF THESE MAINTENANCE UPGRADES. I am selling this at even a lower cost than the parts added to the original price alone, so you would be getting a great deal (plus it looks and drives amazing). Feel free to throw out an offer and we can talk, but again I am in no rush at all. Thank you for visiting my post. \n \nExhaust sound: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS9Ub37yprI \n \nAnd to add to your comfort the car is smogged and registered until February 2018 and I am the second owner. The car comes with a ding shield contract and a yearly clay bar maintenance (when I purchased the car those were the two deals included. Essentially, anytime there is a dent they will take it out for free and anytime during the year you can bring it in for a clay bar and complete interior/exterior cleaning). The car has heated seats and a liner for ski's or snowboards through the middle back seat.  \n \nThe car has 430hp/560tq on the custom tune. It will easily pull on a E90 M3 (my friend has one so this has been confirmed). \n \nList of maintenance modifications: \n\u2022\tSpark plugs \n\u2022\tValve cover gasket \n\u2022\tCoils \n\u2022\tInjectors \n\u2022\tOil filter housing gasket \n\u2022\tHID Ballast \n\u2022\tWeather stripping \n\u2022\tHigh Pressure Fuel Pump has warranty until 120k miles \n\u2022\tThermostat \n\u2022\tWater Pump \n \nList of performance parts installed since purchase: \n\u2022\tH&R springs \n\u2022\tBilstein shocks \n\u2022\tCOBB intake filter \n\u2022\tSynapse charge pipe \n\u2022\tSynapse BOV \n\u2022\tCOBB downpipes (catted for easy smog) \n\u2022\tCOBB full exhaust \n\u2022\tCOBB Intercooler \n\u2022\tCOBB Accessport \n\u2022\tPro Tuning Freaks (PTF) custom 93 octane tune (other tunes including stock one available) \n\u2022\tContinental tires (not my first choice, but very good and tons of tread left) \n \nList of cosmetic parts installed since purchase: \n\u2022\tBlack front grill \n\u2022\tBlacked out chrome trimmings \n\u2022\tWindow tint \n\u2022\tCustom black and yellow vintage plate \n\u2022\tBlack floormats \n\u2022\tApex 18\" rims \n\u2022\tBlack and white BMW badges all around \n\u2022\tCarbon fiber BMW badges in Apex rims \n\u2022\tFront splitter, color matched \n\u2022\tRear M3 spoiler, color matched \n\u2022\tAngel eye daytime white bulbs \n\u2022\tSide reflector eliminated \n \nTotal Cost of Maintenance parts: $3,000 \nTotal Cost of Performance parts: $5,300 \nTotal Cost of Cosmetic parts: $2,500 \n \nTotal Cost of Maintenance install: $4,000 \nTotal Cost of Performance install: $3,000 \nTotal cost of Cosmetic install: $1,000 \n \nTotal cost of car December 2015: $17,500 \nTotal Cost of parts: $10,800 \nTotal Cost of install: $8,000 \n \nTotal Cost I have put in: $36,300 \nMy Asking price: $19,000 \nWear/Aging loss of value for one year: $5,000 \n \nIn my opinion you will be saving over $12,000, even taking into account wear over the last year. Additionally, you will not have to go through the pain of diagnosing, purchasing, and installation times where everything has already been done. I feel like this car is a child of mine since it has had so much work/customization done. Look forward to getting to know the next owner, it will not be easy to let her go. \n \nPlease text, or call and leave a voicemail.  \n \nJeff    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_gyjm8MNxcoE_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_bX09FcZROXL_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_8HPmwUyqDk8_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_hpKeOpWp8i0_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.241700", "lng": "-121.955400", "postId": "5957019096", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/cto/5957019096.html", "postDate": "2017-01-12T18:24:28-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-12T18:37:03-0800", "attributes": "2007 bmw 335i like new 6 cylinders gas 80000 black clean automatic", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/cto/5957019096", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:13.877802", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

Just took to a LBS to get it checked out and tuned before this sale. Since the tune I rode it once and cleaned it, now its up for sale to find a new loving home. I am looking for 650b/27.5 bike at this point as I had this and a 29er and want to try 650b.  \n \nMedium frame \nComes with pedals \n \nMSRP NEW: $6379.99 \n \nYou find new lines on every run, or you make your own, on Trek's Session 88. This world-class downhill rig takes Trek's great aluminum frame and adds Fox's massive 40 fork up front with 203mm of some of the smoothest travel out there. In back, Fox is in control again with a sweet DHX coil delivering 210mm of madness with Trek's Full Floater and ABP suspension designs which isolates the suspension from braking input. Add Sun Ringl\u00c9 tubeless-ready wheels with a massive 12x157mm rear axle, SRAM X9/X0 shifting and the 88's DH-specific geometry and you realize that the view from the top step of the podium is as sweet as they say. \n \nreviews: \n \n ive been riding my 2010 session88 for just over 2 monthes, and it rails everything.... i have built it from the frame up, and i think its worked out at \u00a33000 (baring in mind ive had a few things super cheep) but it is pinned over everything. i took it to a track called foel gasnach yesterday and its rooty, ruted out, rocky, tight, super tech, super steep and it felt like the bike was asking for more and i was absolutely pinning it on some sections .... i had a 2004 V10 before this and the session88 feels alot smootherthan the V10 but still doesnt loose that snappyness when accelerating, and another big plus is that on flowy switchbacksyou litterally let the bike do the work... basicly you dont need to brake, just throw it into the corners and it does the job!  \n \nbottom line......... GET ONE. frame or whole bike. either way with 26\" wheels and 203mm forks you cant go wrong! \n \nI just picked up the 2010 Session with the help of the guys at Trek Bikes. The bike is honestly the best bike I have ridden, super easy to pedal and very plush going down the hill. It takes anything you can throw at it with the 203mm travel. Very responsive with the stock parts, I have yet to change anything on it for the month I have had it. Frame is super sturdy and light for a stock DH bike. I definetly recommend it to any DH racer or anyone that wants a \"Grade A\" bike, you wont regret it! \n \n the best bike i ever possessed, after a few modifications at the front (new low stem, removing the spacers, wider bar) it works perfect, super light, super agile, well-balanced in the air and on the ground, beautiful frame and the suspension concept is unexampled \n \nThe first thing you notice os the sheer beauty of the thing, after you get over that you feel the weight and it truly is unbeleivable.Secondly on the trail it goes round corners like no other Due to the low BB height and the pedaling efficency is on another level. Finally all the components work to the heighest level and compliment the bike nicely, i bought one and never looked back \n \n I love my Session, it pedals better than any 8\" bike I've ever ridden, suspension feels stable but plush, and the top shelf components make this bike great right out of the box. I changed the wheel set, installed a direct mount stem from Sunline, and slapped on my Minions, tubeless of course. I may still change the seatpost and saddle, but otherwise, Trek put out a bike that is just as good as anything I could have built from the frame up. Oh, the big earl pedals are like bricks, I'd recommend a lighter set with a bit lower profile. I'm doing Specialized Lo Pro Mags, in gold. \n \n perfectly tuned suspension. \n \nincredibly light frame.  \n \nstiffer than anyone else. \n \nflickable, yet stable at speed. \n \nin a few words -- it doesn't get any better than this!! \n \n \n \ntrade for: nomad, bronson, v10, bike, specialized, giant, kona, trek, ibis, enduro, xc, hard, tail, bars, grips, cranks, fox, helmet, gloves, pads, mtb, mountain, bike, full, face, chest, protector, yeti, cannonale, intense, tracer, dirt, all, motorcycle, dirtbike, quad, demo 8 downhill bike dh freeride FSR specialized bighit kashima 27.5 park bike worldcup santa cruz carbon intense redbull    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_6SzmOS1eyOL_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00808_2Wgm5n2O9mJ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_2VMF8jsLgWU_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00707_3v8VR2aVJcg_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01414_h4SuvwdsbK6_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_20DuScvO7tB_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00O0O_4qlBV0EarUE_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_f7iS9guEmbW_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01717_56rleiNhNE6_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00R0R_bb5flJzQ6JK_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01414_dACQSi05Khx_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_X1pcBvYcxz_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_bBJYROA3qgU_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.701500", "lng": "-122.078200", "postId": "5924012348", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/bik/5924012348.html", "postDate": "2016-12-18T03:13:40-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-12T21:12:59-0800", "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/bik/5924012348", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:15.269379", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "Roland VS 2400 CD + Roland SI-24 Studio Interface Package", "price": "700", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "berkeley", "description": "\n         \nHere we have a very nice and in excellent condition Roland VS 2400 CD, easy to use and ready to record solo or the whole band! As you most likely know the VS 2400 CD is a self-contained in-the-box unit that does it all, no computer needed. The features are many and this Roland is rated very high, just Google the reviews. BTW, this is up on eBay as well but if it's still up on Craigslist, it's still for sale. \n \nSee http://www.emusician.com/gear/1332/roland-vs-2400cd---the-no-hassle-pro-studio/33329 and https://www.roland.com/us/products/vs-2400cd/ \n \nLike the Korg and Tascam units out there, the VS 2400 CD has everything you need (but a microphone and a set of headphones) to make your high quality 24-track recordings and then burn it down to a CD. But, unlike many of those other units when you plug in a VGA life gets easier! Not only that, it's portable! Use the included well-built anvil case, put it in the car and record a high quality mix of next weekends gig or your buddies' band at their place, leave the computers, interfaces and chords at home! This far exceeds that good old Zoom you have been doing it on and there's no need for a laptop, all the interface equipment and cables, if you go that way now. You can also put the recording in an exportable file and mail it along to the band mates when mixed! Remember, these units have all kinds of in and out connections, check all the documentation on line. \n \nHere's what is included with this package.  \n \nA. First, along with this VS 2400 CD is an included and in very good condition Roland SI-24 Studio Interface, the included (and pricey....) RBUS Cable to connect both machines, giving you eight more XLR inputs for a total of 16! In addition to the eight studio-quality mic preamps, the SI-24 has the motorized faders and a joystick for doing surround panning. The Roland SI-24 also can be used as a \"surface control\" for certain versions of Pro Tools, Cuebase and Lodic PRO. \n \nB. Second, this package includes a very nice LCD 22\" monitor. Looks great and has the picture at a size fitted well for the eyes at near field range. And, I'll include the small little Dell Monitor that came with the package if you want it. I don't think there's anyway to run two monitors but let me know. \n \nC. Third, Lots of documentation and instructional media to get up on day one (one set for you, one for a partner). Two complete sets of DVD and a set of VHS. Two complete Roland VS 2400 CD manuals One complete manual for the Roland SI-24 Studio Interface.

{"title": "Complete vandal proof outdoor megapixel network PTZ security camera", "price": "650", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "campbell", "description": "\n         \nI'm selling a complete outdoor vandal proof HDTV 1080P 300x PTZ network security system: Tyco American Dynamics Illustra 625, Sony Outdoor vandal proof UNIORS7T1, wall mount, power adapter, software.  This is the same as the Tyco American Dynamics ADCi625-P122 excep this system is vandal proof.  The whole system is complete assembled and tested.  It is ready to go and you should be able to just mount it up and start monitoring your property without spending hours looking for parts, assemble the system or configuring things.  I will provide a demo at the time of purchase so you can see how easy it is to hook the camera up and use it as well as seeing the camera in action.  I will include the link to the video of the camera that I recorded during my testing (see link below).   \n \nThe American Dynamic Illustra 625 is a US made camera and it's extremely powerful.  The quality of this camera comparable to those top system out there such as Axis q6035-E or Pelco S5220-EG0; except you pay a fraction of the price.  If you are serious about your business and property and looking for an exception security system, read further down as I will try to describe the camera's features as best as I can so you can make an informed decision. \n \n- Full HDTV 1080P 2MP video resolution with 30x optical zoom:  You no long have to worry about blurry images of a suspicious person 20,30ft away or a vehicle parked a block away.   No matter how small or big your property is, this camera will cover every spot with crystal clear images.  Seeing is believing so I'm providing the actual video of the camera that I recorded during my testing: \n \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiVM4QnwlzI \n \nThe video is a recorded of a browser session.  Because this camera is network camera, you can connect to it using any web browser.  You can then easily view, control and configure the camera from there.  In the video, the jeep is couple hundred feet away and check out the crystal clear image of the license plate when I zoom in.  The trail across the canal is more than 200 yards and I can see people walking and running from the trail.  The low bridge is .5 mile away and the high bridge is 3/4 mile from the camera.  I purposely zoom in and out so you can compare between the actual distances.  You have to see the video for yourself to see how powerful this camera is.  Why spend the same more for some static cameras or some china made cameras that can't provide your the the crystal clear video that this camera can. \n \n- High speed continuous 360\u00b0 pan and 210\u00b0 tilt with real time continuous auto focus:  You will be able to cover every non-obstructed area with this camera since it has an endless 360\u00b0 pan and 210\u00b0.  It has a super fast 510\u00b0 per second movement so you can quickly move to a location.  It will autofocus on objects as you move and zoom so you don't have to adjust anything.  All you have to do is move the camera and zoom in/out of objects and the camera will do the rest of adjusting focus and Iris (for lighting).  In the video, I never had to touch any manual focus or Iris as the camera did everything for me. \n \n- Supports multiple presets, pattern and sequential patrol, and privacy zones:  This camera can be programmed to remember different positions with different zoom levels.  You can quickly move the camera to those presets with a press of a button.  This eliminates the need to manual pan or tilt the camera to the locations that you want to monitor.  You can camera programmed to zoom down the parking lot entrance a few hundred feet away as one preset and another preset to point the camera to the warehouse entrance.  You can then quickly move the camera between these presets within a second or so with a press of a button.  This camera has 96 presets available so you can very much cover all areas on your premise.  \n \n    You can also set the camera to automatically patrol based on a recorded pattern, between the presets, or just scanning.  For areas that you don't want to monitor or displayed, you can set them as privacy zones so the camera will exclude those areas. \n \n- Wide Dynamic Range and True day/night feature for low light support:  This camera support WDR that provide auto adjustments of areas with different lighting condition to ensure that all objects appear clearly.  For example, in half shaded area, this camera can adjust the lighting of the sunny area and the shaded area so that objects don't get to washed out in the sun or to dark in the shade.  This camera is also equipped with ICR (Infrared Cut Filter) which changes the camera from color to black and white mode automatically when lighting condition becomes low.  In ICR mode, the camera can absorb more light so the images can be seen more clearly and it becomes sensitive to Infrared light which allows it to be used with external Infrared illuminators in complete darkness environment (0lux).  This camera can support as low as 0.04lux in black and white mode.   \n \n- Support MicroSD card for local storage area:  This camera does not requirement external devices such as DVR/NVR to be able to record video from the camera.  The micro SD card will provide direct storage on the camera for direct recording, FTP, or emailing.  A 32Gb microSD is included with this system and will be fully inserted and ready to be used. \n \n- Fully ONVIF 2.0 compliant:  ONVIF standard provides cross application compatibility which means that you can use any application  supporting ONVIF to connect to any ONVIF compliant camera to view, record, and control the camera.  So if you have existing ONVIF 2.0 NVR application or devices, you can easily connect them to this camera to view and record video. \n \n- Fully outdoor support:  The housing UNIONS7C1 is equipped with thermostat controlled heater/blower to provide support for outdoor weather environment.  The outdoor housing can support temperature -20\u00b0F (-29\u00b0C) to 122\u00b0F (50\u00b0C).   \n  \nThere are too many features to list them all.

{"title": "2011 Dinan S1 BMW M3 Convertible (w/ extras)", "price": "45500", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "palo alto", "description": "\n         \nMy family has grown and with the addition of a new family car, I have more cars than I have room for and unfortunately it is time to let go of my beloved 2011.75 BMW M3 Convertible.  This car is immaculate, you will not find a cleaner or better cared for M3 around.  This car is fully loaded with every option available from BMW.  The sticker price was almost $90k.  I won't bore you with a page long list, but the bottom line is that if BMW offered it, this car has it.  This car has always been garaged and is professionally detailed twice a year.  No accidents or body work and never tracked. \n \nThis car has 27k miles on it and was used as my commuter from Pleasanton to Palo Alto.  It has been a joy to drive.  I distinctly remember waking up before my alarm in anticipation of my drive to work.  It has never been tracked.  All services have been performed and the car needs nothing.  Tires (Bridgestone RE-71Rs) have ~90% tread and registration is paid and current.  Just take the keys and enjoy. \n \nThe Basics... \n4.0l V8 (One of the best sounding engines of all time) \n7 Speed DCT Transmission \nTop Level Stereo (Individual I Believe) \n2011.75 (Means it has all the upgrades of the 2012 but is technically a 2011) \nRetractable hardtop convertible \n \nOn to the upgrades..... \n \nThe major upgrade is the Dinan S1 kit which was installed by Dinan at a cost of just over $8,500.  The S1 package includes the Dinan Exhaust, Dinan Intake, Engine software upgrade, Dinan Stage 1 Suspension w/ supplemental ride quality and handling kit, Dinan strut tower bars, and Dinan Pedals  In addition to the S1 package the car has Dinan's DCT software upgrade as well. (I did end up removing the intake as Dinan never got it CARB approved). \n \nThe car also has a full custom clear bra on all the front panels.  This is not a pre-cut kit, but a custom wrap by Auto Pro Films.  Cost was $1,500 for the wrap. \n \nWindows were tinted by Rocky Mountain Window Tint professionally at a cost of ~$500. \n \nI also decided to replace the rod bearings.  If you have not researched these cars, you may ask why with such low mileage.  If you have researched these cars, you will know that you can't spend more than 5 minutes on the M3 forum without becoming paranoid that your rod bearings might fail at any minute.  The rod bearings were replace with OEM WPC treated bearings by Performance Technic in Dublin.  If you know BMWs then you know Performance Technic.  Cost was about $2,200 for the bearings. \n \nAlthough this car is fully loaded, I was surprised to find there was never and option for a backup camera.  I added an aftermarket camera that was installed by Alekshop.  Cost was ~$350 installed. \n \nAlekshop also installed the M-performance style carbon rear spoiler.  Cost was ~$500. \n \nThe stock wheels were also coated gloss black inside which hides brake dust very well and looks great. \n \nOver $14k total in upgrades and as you can see, I have only used the best shops in the bay area for any work performed on this car. \n \nFeel free to email with any questions. \n \n \n \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_3AQjWxh9DmD_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_81HLtkSfPxN_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01212_1cwKXffI01_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_iDPGcNwvdgF_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01717_1IGvHVTXOdn_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_yn1tHGvLRm_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_lRkiICJ9D0m_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_beBjjbBKSMg_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_198VfED20KK_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00b0b_2Cy2mY3MSco_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00W0W_9MfSxw3WM0B_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_8PwZCngByOd_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_aenTgbqHrKN_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_83FzlrJJNx_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_9SvSuqjpTGg_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00101_9M6lCj5W0EX_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_gqIDMtzDwLH_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00O0O_6MzxQ83wcHS_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_69NCiOUN3DY_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_dCoIZokYdxf_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_jzjw4MDbtTY_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_wd8Tbtluyn_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_PZ1aKBqBb0_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00O0O_4y1lvPY2CiV_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.418000", "lng": "-122.127400", "postId": "5955357325", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/cto/5955357325.html", "postDate": "2017-01-11T14:47:08-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "2011 BMW M3 excellent 8 cylinders rwd gas 27000 silver clean other convertible", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/cto/5955357325", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:20.125478", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

These Task chairs have ALL the adjustments. They are the top of the line model. Each chair has fully adjustable arms that go in out up and down and swivel , a swivel seat, a sliding seat, seat tilt, seat height, multiple lumbar adjustments and everything.  \n \n \n \n \n \nIt has so many adjustments, that I will even fit the chair for you and teach you how to use it for free.  I took a class to learn how to use it, so i can pass that knowledge on. \n \n \n \n \n \nMore info: \n \n \n \n \n \nThey are the v2 (same design as earlier model v1, however more modern looking and  and an extra arm adjustment that the old ones don't have  these are also the last model  \n \n \nI have a couple of V1 chairs also that are black that you can compare them too if you would like - they also have all the adjustments but they are $250 ea   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have a few left that are matching in the coveted BLACK cloth color and very tame .

They have an upholstered soft comfy cushioned back, and a black seat back. The seat back has a slotted ribbed design that not only allows air-flow but also conforms to your back for the most unique support for all body types/sizes and postures. \n \n \n \nIf you are not familiar with the Steelcase Leap chair, then I suggest you do some research. This is the BEST chair for your back. It is the most ergonomic. It is better than the Herman Miller Aeron Chair. It has won awards from multiple sources INCLUDING THE WALL STREET JOURNAL! Crunchgear.com and other trusted consumer advocates. These are recommended over the humanscale freedom chair as well. Why would these chairs cost over a thousand dollars brand new? Answer: steelcase hired ergonomic scientists to design the chair and study office worker's productivity. This chair was crafted from science. It has been proven in studies to boost productivity by roughly 18%. If payroll is the largest expense a company has, then imagine the investment savings value that this chair holds. \n \n \n \n \n \nIf you have a sore back and are in need of the most confortable chair give me a call. You will love this for your office. I have enough for your conference table too. You can also use them in your home at the computer or cubicle. Your spine will thank you for using this chair. And you might even save money by not having to go to the chiropractor =) \n \nBTW: a few of the chairs are black trim on black leather COACH EDITION   =) $500   \n \nalso one of the blk/blk ones is brand new still unused with the tag on it $420 for that one \nThe v2 with the extended height cylinder is $400 this is for taller tall folks or people with high tops \n \nCall me and I can try to arrange delivery to you for free.  \n \nI am also willing to do a full trade or do a partial trade for laptop electronics gift cards or am open to your suggestions plus partial cash. I love to barter  .. this is what CL is all about. \n \nThese are the recommended chairs to sit in after a ROLFING session.  You need your fascia to rebuild symmetrically and being supported in a proper position while sitting will allow this to happen.  You can then spend less money on mayo fascial release therapy and more money on giving to those causes you love.  =) \n \n \nThanks, \n415 881 774O \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe mid-size chair is similar as the tall back looks identical but it is just slightly higher back that's all.  The versatility and range of height and weight of people these can properly support is amazing - no need for A B or C sizing like the HM chairs  \n \n \n***** UPDATE *****  \n \n \nthe criterions are sold...  \nmirra is gone \n \n$190 DOLLARS??? \n \n \nALSO lastly I finally found out what this other chair is called that I have. . .

This is a semi-professional Flute made by Haynes' Beijing workshop paired with a hand cut Haynes Headjoint. Sterling Silver Tube (Headjoint, Body, and Foot), Silver-Plated Mechanism, B-Foot with Gizmo, Offset-G Key, C Sharp Trill Key, .16 body, Straubinger Pads, and comes with three crowns -- the original heavy silver crown, a cocuswood crown, and grenadilla Trevor James Crown. The Flute was purchased in the Summer of 2010 for Conservatory playing and has been my main instrument up until now. Plating on the mechanism is in excellent condition except on the D-sharp key where there is a little bit of wear from normal use.  \n \nThe instrument has been used in several recordings and solo playing. It has been used in many orchestra concerts and has a beautiful sound -- warm and immediate overtones. The cut of the head joint provides a quick response, even flexibility, and ability to shift between dynamic ranges is a breeze. It was recently serviced by Steve Deutsch in Berkeley. He gave it a full service including pad replacement, key level, and adjustment, ensured the tube is round and all joints fit perfectly, and a cleaning.  \n \nI am letting this instrument go because I have purchased a newer instrument to replace this one. It comes with the original french style case which has a tiny bit of wear on the right-hand corner, and the original leather carrying bag. Also included are a wooden cleaning cloth and Flute Pro Shop polishing clothing. You can view recordings of this flute on my website: artietrodriguez.wix.com/psychomuze \n \nAsking $2500 or best offer.  \n \nSerious buyers only.

It is the quietest computer I've ever built and most people don't even know it is on besides the glowing fans. I wanted to make a computer that could run quietly and efficiently at any load. Even though it may be a few years old it still is cray fast and has a lot of potential for overclocking, although it was never attempted as I didn't have a need. It was hooked up to a 4k monitor and I occasionally played GTA V at well over 60 fps at near maxed out settings. I am letting this creation of mine go because space became and issue and being almost 3 feet tall and 2 1/2 feet long it takes up quite a bit of space. I wish I could keep what I've created but I sadly just need something smaller. The case is not in perfect condition, although it looks pretty good for being a 3 year old case (I bought the case a while before building the computer). Changes have been made overtime so there are some holes inside the case where old tubing was run and what not (as show in the pictures). It is all hard line acrylic tubing inside that I bent slowly with much trial and error. All of the visible fittings are matched, but as you can see in the photos, some of the internal non visible ones are not. There is currently 2 Samsung 512GB 840 Pro SSD's in RAID 0. I will load what ever OS you want onto the computer (it is currently running ubuntu server as I was having some fun with it a while back) and I can attempt to reload OS X onto it for a hacktintosh.

The DDJ-T1 offers the same operability and layout as Pioneer's pro-DJ equipment, while enabling DJs to play music files from the computer via dedicated Traktor DDJ-T1 edition software. \n \nThe controller is in perfect condition. It has hardly been used at home, and has been taken out to one gig only. It sells for $700 new (that's how much I paid for it), but I'm letting it go for $400. A steal. \n \nThe DDJ-T1 easily connects with a user's laptop via USB for quick \"plug-and-play\" capability. For further convenience, the controller also comes with a computer dock that allows a laptop's keyboard to slip directly under the controller, bringing the monitor closer to the DJ, providing fast visuals of song information while mixing. The device adopts Pioneer's \"P-LOCK Fader Cap,\" designed to prevent the fader caps from slipping. \n \nKey Features Include: \n \n* Plug-and-Play USB Connectivity -- All buttons and knobs have been pre-assigned, so users can quickly connect the controller to their laptops by USB cable and start their performances without having to adjust any complicated settings. Additionally, the DDJ-T1 can be powered through the laptop's USB port. \n \n* Specially Designed User Interface -- The controller layout and TRAKTOR software interface are identical, ensuring ease-of-use and precise control. The DDJ-T1 is modeled after the proven design of the professional Pioneer DJ player and mixer and integrates 115mm jog dials, accurate search functionality to quickly find playback points, a load button for song data and a master synch button for beat matching across four channels. \n \n* Highest-Quality Sound -- The controller is optimized for the TRAKTOR DJ software and incorporates technology from Pioneer's professional line of DJ equipment to ensure the highest quality sound output that DJs have come to expect from Pioneer products. \n \nAdditional Features include: \n1. Proprietary lock mechanism called the P-LOCK Fader Cap designed to prevent fader caps from slipping. \n2. Premiere built-in sound card \n \nFor detailed specifications, visit  \nhttp://www.pioneerelectronics.com/PUSA/DJ/Controllers/DDJ-T1#overview \n \nTraktor software is not included.

{"title": "Vintage 1960s Teisco electric guitar", "price": "200", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "lower haight", "description": "\n         \nSadly parting with my beloved Teisco single pickup electric guitar. I sold my amp a few months back, so hanging onto this seems a little silly and it was starting to look more like dollar signs sitting in a case.  \n \nPurchased early in 2014 at DiPinto Guitars in Philadelphia, this guitar has most certainly had a long and loving life in the line of duty. Can't speak on its history before owning it myself, but it had clearly been well-used and well-loved. \n \nThis lil guy's got one single pickup with a volume and tone nob, super simple. I really love the sound of this thing, its got a really great range even with the one tone control. I've never been into guitar gear with a million knobs and buttons so this is ideal if thats your approach too. With a pretty thin neck and body, you can really bend and shake the whole instrument if you wanna get weird and wobbly. Of course, this means it won't hold its tune if you go nuts but thats sort of obvious. Thats probably the only downside to this guitar, given its age it needs pretty consistent tuning-peg tweaking to keep it in tune. Could certainly use a setting-up by a pro.  \n \nCosmetic wear all around (I mean, its 50 years old, I'm just glad it still works). Missing one of the screws from the pick-guard but thats easily replaceable if you care (I obviously didn't, it still plays \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af ). Couple stickers too, if you want I can peel those off before a sale.  \n \nSO, if you're looking for a guitar with a story and a history, just want a unique instrument (still have never seen this exact model #rare), or wanna look like Mac Demarco or make a Mac Demarco ripoff band and indulge in reverby weed-grunge and look super hip doing it then THIS IS YOUR WEAPON.  \n \nAsking $200 cash \n \nI've got a hard case that the guitar fits in as well. The case isn't made for the Teisco, but the guitar is fairly small so it fits. I would say it'll likely fit in most cases with a bit of room to spare. $200 firm with the case included. If you just take the guitar, we can maybe negotiate on price.  \n \n \n \nemail me or text: 6 one 0 seven 4 two 7 two 8 five \n \n \nscammers lowballers can soak their heads \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00202_cX3Kexhh2uR_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00707_aVw6JNjrbYS_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_lX54uIxD4d2_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00404_jXnI7OahzKX_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_2NN0KeAVQa5_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01515_ZiO3x1ibI8_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.774903", "lng": "-122.431012", "postId": "5950037562", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/msg/5950037562.html", "postDate": "2017-01-07T16:54:27-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-11T13:05:11-0800", "attributes": "fair", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/msg/5950037562", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:27.543773", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

It has a 18\" frame (I am 5'7\"). This bicycle has all Shimano XTR components and hydraulic disc brakes. This is a full suspension mountainbike. I purchased this mountainbike back in 2004. It has upgraded components. Everything you see was top of the line in 2004 (other than the frame itself: S-Works) such as Mavic rims, XTR everything, S-Works handle bar, Thomson Elite stem, Fox Forx shocks, Chris King headset, and more. As-is with the components shown, it cost $5500 back then.  \nThe bicycle is in excellent condition (has some minor scuffs, scratches as expected from a bicycle this age). I've put less than 1000 miles on this bike in it's lifetime, and I've done roughly 20 tune-ups (average 2 a year). I've replaced the chain a few times, tires, and other parts. I am always being told that the bicycle is in amazing condition. It is ultra-light for a mountainbike and handles extremely well. You won't find anything better for this price. The technology for mountain bikes has not changed that much in the last decade. Great for single track, off-road, or as a daily cruiser. Nothing but premium components only. \n \nThe only reason why I am selling this bicycle is due to on-going/chronic knee problems. I can longer ride pain-free. I've put less than 10 miles on it in the last 1 1/2 years. It's tine to let it go so someone else can enjoy it. \n \nPlease note: the front shock is not locking out properly anymore.

Gopro not included. \n \nThese were special editions which have the upgraded NAZA v2 board for better GPS reliability, the gimbal adjustment lever on the back of the controller, screw off propellers for better transport and swap out, and an easy to access sync button for syncing a new transmitter if needed (before u would have to take the shell apart)   \n \nIn addition to those featutures I have installed the summitlink snap on/off prop guards (along with drilled access holes in the snap on mounts for easier future motor access), a new in bag set of oem Dji propellers, an extra DJI battery without that many cycles, a cleanly installed brushless Walkera G-2D gimbal which i installed longer screws so yes it will fit will your older Go pro hero 2 wide body or hero 3, etc.  you can record hd video and audio along with top down and straight ahead views, btw do not use the gopro's wifi.  (gopro not included). No jelly effect on the video, beautiful stable recordings.  New in box Balance charger BC20-4 never used for lipo or LiFe, 1s,2s,3s, or 4s with US and international AC power plugs, the fixed gopro mount is also included, along with the standard shorter landing legs if you decide to remove the gimbal.   \n \nThe latest firmware is installed and everything works flawlessly and is ready to fly!  Software linking to pc works great where you can dial in gimbal throws, altitude limits, and program the transmitter switches if you want.  Current right switch setup is GPS mode, attitude mode, and return to home.  Also you are able to enable flight characteristics with the left transmitter top switch to suit beginners regardless of nose direction and of course if the transmitter is turned off it will fail safe return to home. \n \nNever crashed and in really excellent condition, never had any problems with this drone!  If this is your first drone, I can walk you through it. \n \nLocated in Campbell \n \n \n \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_kTJu5uXDzeU_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00W0W_llY9qPKY2HD_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01515_en8GuX6Ccgu_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_kRTxr748QUO_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01111_ePbSjfY0FUd_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_hZnkIxJCV9J_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00606_6eONdgl32L8_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_e0YM4NRscIa_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_lHzHyoL4UP8_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_cLGFIWaKYm1_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_bb3RrQ3dt1c_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_7GiHmkhjfD8_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_8P7dDJKxkPd_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_kpRRbHJaxLl_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01717_aHlp2wPdYS1_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_gqDUsrsTlrc_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_7880cVXpkWn_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.288387", "lng": "-121.945195", "postId": "5946745090", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/tag/5946745090.html", "postDate": "2017-01-05T10:24:06-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-09T11:01:58-0800", "attributes": "like new DJI Phantom", "locAccuracy": "highest", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/tag/5946745090", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:30.764557", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "2016 Scott Genius 710 Plus - Year End Sale - Size Small in Stock", "price": "3499", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "campbell", "description": "\n         \nThe 2016 Genius 710 Plus from Scott represents the next big thing to hit the dirt. Designed around a new wider hub and bottom-bracket profile, called Boost, and clearance for 3 inch wide tires on 27.5 inch rims the Genius 710 Plus brings an entirely new level of traction and control to the trail. Add the proven full-suspension design of the Scott Genius to this bigger platform and the result is a bike that devours big roots or small boulders and sticks to slippery singletrack without slowing down. SRAM GX1 components equip this plus-sized bike with a 11 speed drivetrain and the additional clearance to truly go anywhere. The stopping duties are aptly handled by a set of Shimano hydraulic disc brakes with 180mm rotors front and back. \n \nScott adds 3 inch wide tires to 27.5 inch wheels to create their amazingly fun and versatile Genius 710 Plus. The result is an all-new bike that will float through sand, fly over loose rocks and cling to corners like nothing before it. Over the last few years we have seen mountain bike wheels grow taller, now they are getting fatter like those on this 27 plus equipped trail tamer. These bigger tires add substantial stability and traction to an already talented full-suspension bike. With superior traction a plus-sized bike makes easy work of rocky climbs and rolls effortlessly down tricky descents while added stability will keep bike, and rider, upright in almost any condition. The Genius 710 Plus features Scott's HMF carbon construction for the mainframe and an alloy swingarm to deliver a fat bike at a light weight and the inclusion of tubeless tires and rims save a bit of weight as well. Not only does the Genius 710 Plus sport the latest wheel size it also comes with a SRAM 11 drivetrain and Reverb dropper post as stock equipment. It's GX1 components use a 10-42 cassette and 30 tooth chainring up front for an impressive range of gears from this simple system. The height-adjustable dropper post allows the rider to put the saddle down and out of the way when negotiating tuff or steep terrain, the seat then pops back into place at the push of a lever. As with other versions of the Genius the 710 Plus uses Fox 34 Float front fork and Fox Nude suspension to add another level of comfort and control to this popular bike. For those wanting all the newness the Scott Genius 710 Plus will quickly become their favorite bike to ride anywhere. \n \nGoing on a cross country ride?  No worries, swap out the plus wheels for 29er's (not included) and hit the twinloc from full suspension to half and you're off on a speed racer. \n \nWe have S, M or XL currently available.  \n \nHere are Genius 710+'s details: \n \nFrame:    Genius PLUS Carbon / IMP / HMF /BB92 / Alloy swingarm with 180PM, U-Mono Link / Tapered Headtube, IDS SL dropouts for 148x12mm Boost, 3.0\" Tire clearance / BB height adj. 130mm rear travel \n \nTravel: Front: 140mm , Rear: 130mm \n \nFork: FOX 34 Float Performance Elite Air, FIT4 3-Modes with low speed adj.

With the backing of the huge Aeolian company, George Steck was able to produce an extraordinary number of high quality pianos and player pianos during the first part of the 20th Century.

I recorded a shit ton of music on it and it never failed. The only reason I'm selling is because I upgraded to ProTools 11 and has to get a Digi 003 to be compatible.  Its a bummer because this 002 is way better than the 003. Its missing one cap on the knob but it works perfectly. Details below. Does not come with ProTools software. \n \nIf the post is up then its still available. Email with questions. \n \n \nProduct Details: \nDigi002 - FireWire-Based Music Production System \nWorking with your computer through a single FireWire connection, Digi002 pairs with an integrated control surface to provide you with an ideal, finger-friendly music production environment. Record, edit, process, mix, and master your projects with hands-on efficiency, then tuck Digi002 under your arm, take it to a gig, and use it as an 8x4x2 digital mixer complete with EQ, dynamics, delay, and reverb with snapshots. \nDigi002 Basics  \nIntroducing Digi002, Digidesign's first FireWire-enabled workstation to include an integrated control surface. Digi002 offers novices and pros alike hands-on command of any project, easy connectivity via FireWire and integrated I/O, portability, dual mode functionality, and full session compatibility with other Pro Tools systems, from Mbox to Pro Tools|HD. \nThe Essentials \nDigi002 is a full-featured studio-in-a-box that works with your computer to give you all you need for superior MIDI and audio production. Comprised of a single unit that includes a comprehensive control surface along with analog, digital, and MIDI I/O, Digi002 communicates with your computer via a single FireWire cable (included). \nDigi002 System \nDigi002 includes 2 modes of operation: Pro Tools mode, and Standalone mode. With the push of a button, your Digi002 unit enters Standalone mode and becomes an 8x4x2 digital mixer, complete with EQ, dynamics, delay, and reverb with snapshots. In this mode, and your computer is no longer needed for Digi002 to operate. \nWith its FireWire connectivity, getting your Digi002 system up and running is comfortably simple.

{"title": "Toyota Tundra  drop-in plastic bedliner", "price": "300", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "dublin / pleasanton / livermore", "description": "\n         \nPt27134070-drop in bed liner for sale. This fits my 2016 crew max Tundra TRD Pro . My truck has the standard 5.5 ft bed with bed rail system. So this bed liner fits all 5.5 ft beds (short bed) on any tundra trim 2007-2016 that has the bed rails system. WILL NOT WORK FOR A TRUCK WITHOUT THE BEDRAIL SYSTEM- There are TWO types of bed liners one for non bedrail track system and one for integrated bedrail track system ; you can email me if you don't understand the difference.  \n \nNote: If your truck doesn't have the bed rail system and you still want this bedliner, then you can easily add it, but you have to buy this item separately (~$150) and I am NOT selling mine. Will say though: if you want to add a bedliner, it is really worth it to add bed rail system as it increases the functionality of your truck. \n \nThe bedliner was an option included in the truck when I bought it. So I've only had the bedliner in for 6 months now and it is as good as new. Toyota dealer will sell this at 401 + tax (not including install). So they will sell it for ~$440. Get it cheaper here. \n \nFYI: If you have them install it they will charge $539  + tax  (includes bed liner and installation). \n \nThis is not a hard part for you to install by yourself (pre-drilled holes in every truck already) - dealers just like to make as much money as they can, wherever they can. \n \nSelling it because my family and I use the truck for camping/outdoors stuff and a bedrug under a Tonneau will go really nicely.  \n \nBe wary of buying a similar item online. Displayed price may not include shipping cost (this is a big thing to ship) and you may not get what is advertised. Buy here and save yourself the hassle or extra cost. \n \nThe drop in bedliner I am selling is an authentic Toyota part. Also comes with the tailgate liner. All new. Sturdy. Durable. Great looking! \n \nThanks for your interest! Please contact by email. Pick up in Mountain House or Livermore.

Over all the truck gets about 15MPG highway as it sits. If you choose to re-gear you'll see better mileage and torque, I just never got around to that portion. With this set up the only thing left is gears and lockers. \n \nTuck has a few ding and scratches as you would expect an off road vehicle to have.

Just got a new job now where I can't use personal computers due to security so selling this rig so I don't accidentally turn it into another gaming project. \n \nThe best part of the build is the \"custom\" Ikea Helmer case.  It blends in anywhere, including an office. The Spotswood aluminum X rail-based insert takes up the top 3 draw slots but leaves the bottom 3 drawers for storage.  The Spotswood AL rail insert can go into any existing Ikea Helmer case too so you can easily (and cheaply) change the outer drawer system (color, etc).   \n \nThe build is currently air-cooled and runs on the i7's iGPU (Intel HD 530) but the  can support a full-length GPU and comes with the GPU support beam.  Great airflow so keeps everything cool.  \n \nThe case could also fit radiators and extra rails could be installed to support just about any SDD/HDD config (see spotswoodcomputercases website).  I will include all additional hardware that came with the Spotswood case and you can contact the vendor (or mod your own) for additional rails, supports etc for a fully custom config. \n \nAgain, would make a great gaming setup if you just add your graphics card of choice.    \n \nBoot m.2 SSD and HDDs will be formatted prior to sale.

{"title": "Native American Flute with lessons in San Mateo - a beginner's dream!", "price": "89", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "san mateo", "description": "\n         \nBeginners - you don't need to learn to read or play sheet music in order to play this instrument !! \n \n~ I'll teach you how to play by ear and provide you with all the tools you need in order to quickly learn, play and master this ancient instrument.   \n~ I'll teach you a special technique that is unique to playing this flute that will give you the primary skill you need to start playing after just one lesson. . ..watch this Bobby McFerrin video for a hint !!!     \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne6tB2KiZuk \n \n \nI have a very good selection of Native American Flutes for sale.  They are made by some of the finest craftsmen in the Southwest, who use sustainable woods and a very unique uni-body construction method (these flutes are made from the one piece of wood, unlike most flutes that are made from two pieces of similar wood glued together. . .this creates a more cohesive sound and a flute that will never split apart). \n \nIn addition to the flutes listed below I am also offering in person or Skype lessons.  The flutes range in price from $89 to $210 and that means that you can have a world class, crafted instrument in your hand along with all the skills you need to know in order to play a fully improvised song for less than $165!!!. . .Considering the cost of professional ongoing music lessons and the cost of instruments such as the guitar or keyboards this represents a tremendous value! \n \n \nIn all my years of playing I have never once read a traditional sheet of music NOR have I used a fingering chart (a visual aid showing you what holes to cover and leave open).  You can play using the more traditional (western) ways and it will eventually enhance your abilities, however, there is a fantastic amount of enjoyment to be had in learning how to create and improvise your own music. Its 100% possible for you to be recording your own music and YouTube videos within 4 weeks of first playing this instrument! \n \nI have been playing this style of flute for over 13 years but I learned to play it in just one afternoon and I'll gladly pass on all the techniques and tips I've picked up over the years.  In particular, and as previously mentioned there is one \"secret\" technique that aids in mastering this magical instrument and I'm more than happy to share it with you. \nI will teach you how to play this beautiful instrument by ear with a hands on approach WITHOUT you having to learn to read music - There is no need for years of lessons in order to play like a pro!  \n \n \nMy fateful flute story (short version) - How I learned to play and how you can to! \nIt was the week after September the 11th and my sweetheart and I were on a visit to Portland, Oregon.  We were at the Saturday market and a vendor selling his own hand made flutes had set up a stall displaying his wares.  I've been fascinated by this incredible instrument all my life and I had always wanted to play it (I was in my early thirties and wasn't thrilled about having to go through the agony of years of lessons!).  I passed by the flute maker's stall three times before what was once just a whisper in my head of \"Gosh I'd love to play that instrument but I just don't have the patience to learn to read music\" grew so loud that I decided to stop and admire the flutes and just talk with the seller.  After some initial chit chat the flute maker told me that his flutes were very easy to play and that all I needed was the desire to learn to play and the ability to learn a very simple fingering technique that would allow me to more or less start creating my own songs.  I spent a few minutes listening to him, followed the simple instructions and thankfully followed my gut instinct and bought my very first cedar wood flute!  THANK THE UNIVERSE that I listened to my inner voice that day because I gave myself an incredible gift that has enhanced my life to no end.  That same night while practicing under the stars on the deck of a bed and breakfast overlooking the Hood River Valley I received my very first compliment regarding my flute playing!  I can't imagine my life without music and it's for this very reason that I hope you can enjoy the many riches that come along by playing one of these \"magical\" flutes. \n \nSooooo. . . If you \n \n~ Have always had that voice in your head whispering \"I'd love to learn to play an instrument BUT.....\" \n~ Like music but have never taken the step to learn how to play. . . \n~ Have felt overwhelmed by the prospect of having to learn the \"rules\" of music \n~ Had difficulty with reading or learning 'traditional' music  \n~ Tried to learn an instrument but never quite \"got the hang of it\" \n. . ..then this instrument and my lessons may well be what you've been wishing for all these years !!! \n \n \nCurrent flutes (CA tax needs to be added to the prices listed below) \n \n~ Birch, tuned to the key of high F#, $89 \n~ Birch, tuned to the key of C, $98 \n~ Birch, tuned to the key of B, $95 \n \n~ Aromatic Cedar, tuned to the key of A, $129 \n~ Spanish Cedar, tuned to the key of A, $115 \n~ Walnut, tuned to the key of A, $115 \n \n~ Aromatic Cedar with Turquoise inlay, tuned to the key of G, $219 \n~ Walnut, tuned to the key of G, $159 \n \n~ Aromatic Cedar, tuned to F#, $185 \n~ Walnut with Turquoise inlay, tuned to F#, $180 \n \n~ Spanish Cedar, bass flute tuned to low D, $225 - this has a very deep and soulful 'earth' tone. \n \n~ Individual flute stand, $19 \n \n~ One lesson (50 minutes) -- in person in the San Francisco Bay Area or nationwide via Skype - $65.   Follow up lessons can be scheduled IF needed. \n \nNote that the Aromatic Cedar Flute in the key of F# (sharp) makes a distinct sound and tone that most people associate with the Native American Flute and it is one of the finest instruments of any type that you will come across at this price point.  \n \nVideo clip of flutes for sale;   http://youtu.be/-I12nJh0LtQ \n \nSound samples of me playing some of the flutes;  https://soundcloud.com/daniel_barry \n \n \n \nI look forward to hearing from you. . ..call/text me on \n  \nif you have any questions. \n \nPlease note that I've just started this business so a web-site and YouTube videos will follow. \n \n \n \n \nKey words: Silver flute, Irish Low whistle, Japanese flute, Chinese flute, Shakuhachi, embouchure, wind instrument, reed, music tuition, master teacher, oboe, clarinet, saxophone, saxaphone, trumpet, trombone, band instrument, bassoon, piccolo, french horn,    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_asf4KK6VSLb_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00909_gQ5l89uEpLx_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_2LU1qcvXGBH_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_8xme91Kjc1j_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_3pZlcZSl14s_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00O0O_63sgssHUjP5_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_ct8hzNdFzOz_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_6J9oiKQFdY0_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_4Q0AjQKm04d_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_85HInbpKtNf_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00h0h_374SLElLGot_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00909_cY9oGlhZsTr_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00505_8HYWcIEL6WZ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00b0b_7lcUIttC8RY_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00505_6OElc4WbhnL_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_8KKly9PYjq9_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_huCLBCefw1B_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00303_7KyOhdv1yhW_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_vGgVWlZo0N_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_4kaXg9WOYCA_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_jxzDvydhTkw_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_9jHB2Dh1SXj_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_gvXMbjqZ6HU_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_iuKrzKbWKkR_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.531125", "lng": "-122.286719", "postId": "5931333582", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/msd/5931333582.html", "postDate": "2016-12-23T18:01:41-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-09T01:15:08-0800", "attributes": "new Flute", "locAccuracy": "highest", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/msd/5931333582", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:38.567486", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "2016 Ridley Orion Di2 Road Bike - Size Medium", "price": "1500", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "los altos", "description": "\n         \nBought this for my daughter and because it was a great deal.  She's not into it.   \n \nThe Ridley Orion is one of the most versatile bikes in Ridley's line-up. Designed for speed, comfort, and performance, the carbon fiber Orion is perfect for all-day rides, gran fondos, and anyone who wants to get more out of every ride. \nThe Orion frame tubes are diamond shaped for strength and durability, while the geometry and taller headtube promise plenty of comfort and exceptionally stable handling. According to Ridley, the bike offers \"comfort, stiffness, and strength in equal measure\", but this is no take-it-easy weekend path and pavement bike. This is one of the toughest, race-ready bikes (it even has the UCI approval sticker on the downtube, for extra legit-ness) you'll find anywhere, with plenty of get-up and go. It also just happens to deliver an amazingly comfortable ride as well. \n \nThe frame is made with high modulus unidirectional carbon fiber formed into Ridley's distinctive diamond shape for rugged strength and durability. The taller headtube both alleviates stress on the lower back while riding and enhances frame stiffness by eliminating the need to use as many headset spacers. \n \nThe carbon fiber fork features a medium rake that gives the bike the ability to dive into turns without feeling twitchy or unstable. The carbon fiber arms and alloy steerer help absorb road vibrations and smooth out the ride. \n \nFor 2016, the Orion comes with a Shimano Ultegra Di2 6870 groupset. With Di2, Changing gears has never been so easy, effortless and fast. Ultegra Di2 features an automatic trimming front derailleur, so you never have to hear the sound of chain rub again. The shifters act with digital push button shifting and are ergonomically shaped for optimal comfort and control. The lever reach adjust fits all hand sizes. The Di2 rear derailleur is pre-programmed allowing you to shift gear quickly and accurately in all conditions. The battery, at the heart of the drivetrain, uses lithium ion technology and guarantees a range of 1,250 miles, or almost half the length of the Tour de France, before it needs to be recharged, which only takes just 90 minutes. \nRounding out this impressive package is a build kit from Ridley's own 4Za brand. 4Za is in many ways unlike some other company's house brand component arms. Ridley engineers every 4Za component to integrate seamlessly with their bikes at a basic level, ensuring optimized performance at every level. The bike rolls on a set of lightweight Alex Rims clinchers, which spin up quickly, climb like they mean it, and deliver superb braking performance. \n \n \nFeatures: \n \nDeveloped with input from the pro-tour level Damocles and Excalibur frames \nUnique Ridley fit utilizes a traditional geometry and taller headtube, so you need fewer spacers, creating a stiffer, more stable frame \nHigh modulus carbon fiber makes the Orion stiff when you stand up out of the saddle on hard efforts, but allows more compliance for comfort on long rides \nDiamond-shaped tubing makes the Orion stronger and more durable \nShimano Ultegra Di2 6870 11-speed electronic drivetrain will revolutionize the way you ride    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/01313_8fRLi9sVciK_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00808_dbLu7fQq1fr_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01515_8Oquvipr6IQ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_7hcDPJquV8D_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_e14gDWvnUJy_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.354041", "lng": "-122.088873", "postId": "5951998463", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/bik/5951998463.html", "postDate": "2017-01-09T09:47:34-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "new Ridley Orion Medium", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/bik/5951998463", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:39.478217", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "1995 Grey BMW 325i OBO (Not passing Smog)", "price": "2300", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "sebastopol", "description": "\n         \nHey CL, up for sale is my 1995 BMW 325i (premium package when it ws bought), it's currently not passing smog for the second time due to high Hydrocarbons and is being sold as is. I will non op it at the end of the month.  \nThe car runs great and I'm not sure why it's not passing, it could be as simple as an 02 sensor or as bad the engine being worn or the catalytic converters (but I don't think so) , I'm not sure so..my loss could be your gain.  I'm currently a student and I using it purely for commuting back and forth and shopping and things like that, I've never raced it. I've always taken good care of it I've owned the car since 145k and I've always used 91 from either Costco or the Chevron and let it warm up for a couple minutes everytime before I drive it. It has always been on a full synthetic oil and currently is on relatively new oil at around 4k miles on it. It has some issues but none of them relate to actual performance or safety of the car and would be an easy fix for anyone car savvy, I'd say they are expected for a car that's from the mid 90's.  \n \nPro's \n- the engine pulls hard and feels really strong, honestly I've driven other 325i's and mine is really peppy. \n-new oem copper plated spark plugs \n-new Myle HD control arms with heavy duty ball joints \n-new Myle HD front brake lines & new brake fluid/flush  \n-new allignment \n-new struts (can't remember the name atm) \n-new pcv breather hose \n-newish full synthetic oil \n-new radiator expansion tank \n-newish air filter \n-newish cabin filter \n-newish transmission fluid \n-new passenger side rear strut mount \n-newish tires \n \nCons \n-Clutch at 25% life but grabs strong and has no signs of giving out soon \n-Not passing smog  \n-ABS light on just because of a malfunctioning sensor on the right front side (easy fix I just havent gotten around to it yet). \n-Was keyed in the past before I owned it but only on one side \n-hood is oxidizing in the center and it's noticeable (rest of the paint looks good) \n-passenger side windshield wiper no longer workers \n-drivers side window doesn't track correctly/ is broken so I keep it closed (motor workers however) \n-lights that show mileage don't work (they come once but then went away...not sure whats up but you can easily see the mileage) \n-drivers side seat upper portion back adjustment gear is broken so the seat doesn't recline BUT it's stuck in the perfect position..go figure haha. \n-drivers seat has a tear in the bottum portion where you sit BUT it has never englarged since I've owned it or have I ever felt it while driving. \n \nThe car is my DD and is definitely not perfect but it looks nice and is a clean car (will post pictures soon) I've decided to get a much new car after owning it for over a year.

Maybe it's your brother-in-law, or your neighbor, or some guy at your workplace. He's always telling you what he's going to do . . . but he never really does anything. But there's another kind of guy too--someone who turns every day into something that's fun. Every weekend he comes back with a story to tell, even if he never crossed a state line. \n \nHonda's new VFR\u00ae1200X is built for people who know adventure isn't someplace you go, it's what you do getting there. It's an excellent machine for exploring the world around you, and doing it in comfort, confidence, and style. Sporty, athletic, nimble enough for around-town cruising or tight winding back roads, it's also big enough to reel in those highway miles, and see the Statue of Liberty, Mount Rushmore, and the Alamo all in the same trip. \n \nWhere will a new 2016 Honda VFR1200X take you?

The 883L truly lives up to its name for the 50th, with its saddle sitting lower than ever this year. Your backside rides just over 25 inches off the pavement, urged on by the steady cadence of an 883 cc Evolution\u00ae V-twin. You'll notice how the flat handlebar comes back to meet your fists, and the reduced effort on the clutch. It's a feeling you'll want to go on for eternity. But once in a while you've got to plant the side stand. That's when the low seat makes it easy for a rider of any stature to set both boots down flat on the ground. You realize that the whole bike is designed with rider ergonomics in mind. Once again, low is proving the comfortable way to go. \n \n  Hollister Powersports \n \n                                                    hollisterpowersports.com \n \n                                                     Phone# 831-630-5200 \n \n                                 Hours: Monday through Saturday 9am to 6pm \n \n                                                      The Best Customer Service \n                                                               We make Deals \n                                                          Huge Inventory on hand \n                                      Custom Painted Indians and Victory Motorcycles \n                                                   Polaris Side by Sides and ATV's \n                                 Pre-owned makes and models including Harley Davidson \n                                   Large selection of new Honda and Kawasaki products \n \n                                                               We take Trade-Ins \n                                                                    We deliver \n                                                              Financing available \n                                                      Parts, Accessories and Service \n \n                                                               411 San Felipe Rd. \n                                                              Hollister CA 95023 \n \n                                        Prices shown are after all rebates are recognized \n                                    Applicable Tax, License and Destination set up fees are extra \n  \nWe attempt to update our postings in a timely manner however Hollister Powersports can't guarantee that the inventory shown will be available at the dealership.

I bought the vehicle in March 2014 with 27,000 miles, it currently has 33,500 miles on the odometer.  \n \nThis car is in excellent condition -- always garaged and always protected with a car cover when parked outdoors. This is a weekend cruising car perfect for trips down Pacific Coast highway or a top-down jaunt through the city. The V8 engine has immense torque and a low, guttural growl that isn't too aggressive- together with the upgraded suspension package and wider tires makes for exciting highway on-ramps and runs down Skyline Drive.  \n \nThis SL63 has never been in an accident and does not need any maintenance.  \nStandard SL63 options include: \n- Hand-built 6.3L V8 engine producing 518 horsepower/465 lb-ft torque (car came from the factory with a DVD of its engine being built) \n- 7 speed dual clutch manumatic transmission (0.100 sec shifts in manual control mode) with paddle shifters and three driving modes \n-14.2 inch 6-piston ventilated front brakes and 13.0 inch 4-piston ventilated rear brakes \n- AMG Sport Exhaust \n- 19\" Wheels with 255/35 front and 285/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport Pro tires \n- Automatic retracting hardtop that works flawlessly- no binding, hesitation, or issues. No repairs ever needed to this mechanism. \n- 12-way adjustable heated, massaging seats with memory (perfect condition -- no scratches, scuffs, or wear present) \n- Alcantara headliner (in perfect condition) \n- 6-disc stereo-navigation system with 40GB hard drive, Bluetooth connectivity, and voice command. Harmon-Kardon speakers still in perfect condition -- no fading drivers. Sirius satellite radio compatible -- though I never used it.  \n- iPhone/mobile audio connection in center console (works with iPhones 4, 5, and 6) -- includes stereo jack for any other portable audio device.  \n \nOriginal MSRP was $159,675, including $21,200 in additive options: \n- Option 219 -- Parktronic: Sensor-assist front and rear collisions detection \n- Option 220 - Distronic: Adaptive Cruise Control  \n- Option 033 - Designo interior in Mocha Black (pearlescent medium brown highlights that show up really well in bright sunlight) \n- Option 217 - Red AMG Premium Leather \n- Option H73 - Carbon Fiber trim package (interior and exterior carbon elements) \n- Option 030 - AMG Performance Package including: 19\" AMG forged alloy wheels, AMG Limited Slip Differential (LSD), Track-calibrated Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system, AMG performance steering wheel (hollow alloy spokes and flat bottom), increased governing speed to 186mph \n- Suspension lifts to clear obstacles and steep grades in the road \n- Suspension has Comfort (suppresses rough road conditions) and Sport (aggressively enhances handling capability) driving modes which are really significant, unlike many German sports cars where these modes only make minor changes.  \n- Option P01 - Premium Package, consisting of: activated ventilated (heated and cooled) seats, electronic trunk closer, Airscarf (heated headrest blower), and Keyless Go (push-button start and keyless entry) \n \nThe engine is in mint condition. I never experienced any hesitation or detonation; it doesn't burn any oil or knock on startup. The motor pulls strong through the rev range. Transmission shifts rapidly every time. I have not had a single repair needed since I purchased the vehicle. I never saw any DTC records appear (check engine light).   \n \nInterior is in mint condition. All electronic systems work perfectly and I know it connects with iPhone generations 4, 5 and 6.  \n \nExterior is in excellent condition -- there is one minor blemish on the front fender that was present when I bought it in March of 2014. Paint is in excellent condition -- I wax and clay block it regularly. I replaced the lower lip on front bumper due to scratches from the occasional steep driveway.  \n \nThe 2009 SL63 is a well-built car produced after the breakup of DaimlerChrysler (often noted for the reduced build quality of Mercedes Benz vehicles under their reign) and has no Recalls, Investigations, or Complaints according to the National Highway Transportation Administration (NHTSA: www.safercar.gov).  \n \nThis car, like most used vehicles sold privately, is sold as-is with no implied or expressed warranty. Buyer may have the vehicle inspected at their own cost at a reputable local mechanic.  \n \nAt this time, I am not interested in trades. Serious buyers only please.  \n \n \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00S0S_bprpcNP7lts_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_ajZ2UszNBJ8_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01010_6slCjaRCFL4_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00101_26jvG3R0ZEN_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_984ebWGtitB_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_1pvfFbL8rfR_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_5DuwU5obHe7_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00000_18AhgsndaO2_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_gh4SdOqO65B_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_ccLi6dC7Zrk_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_zekU6DyOl5_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_6qRNPoZh9rB_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_9oebCIlHqYP_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_l4wQy618DYV_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_cQbBPSBPn6H_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_9ss9T8oraGI_600x450.jpg"], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5912740550", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/cto/5912740550.html", "postDate": "2016-12-09T13:51:36-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-11T15:16:08-0800", "attributes": "2009 Mercedes Benz SL63 like new 8 cylinders rwd gas 33500 black clean other convertible", "locAccuracy": "medium", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/cto/5912740550", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:50.401437", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "1970 VW Beetle", "price": null, "priceUnit": null, "cityName": null, "description": "\n         \nREAD the whole ad 1st.  It should answer the vast majority of your questions.  Last 2 weeks then pulling the ad down (will be up later, but will be stripped of all the good parts...will only have stock parts).  Not interested in parting the car out.  What ever doesn't go with the car goes to the next project.  Pics are older but the car looks the same just with fenders on the front and no rear bumper. Here's the details on my 70:  \n \nBODY:  \n \nIn great shape with no accident damage that I can see. Paint is dull but it shines up really well. Has pop-out rear windows, stock door windows, windshield is perfect and the rear window has no defrost strips. Is missing the running boards and bumpers. I've changed out the front fenders with a set from a pre-67 with glass lenses (fenders are primered and the headlight units are brand new aftermarket units with 911 lenses). I've installed a set of GAB FAB carb windows in the rear quarters (fantastic quality). The only problems is the engine firewall has some bad welding and there is 1 spot of rust on the front driver side quarter panel (about 1\" x 3\" long). (1) key opens the doors and works the ignition.  \n \nPAN/SUSPENSION: Pans have been coated with POR-15. Passenger side pan was replaced by BuggyHouse in Hayward with a unit from Wolfsburg West. Front beam is a 2\" adjustable narrowed unit from CB Performance with everything except for the steering box replaced. Has (4) wheel discs in a stock 4x130 pattern (by CB Performance). All brake hard lines have been replaced with lines from Wolfsburg West with S/S soft lines. Master cylinder is a German unit with a 2lb residual valve. Brakes and the ebrake work like the should. But, could use a tiny bit of bleeding ((almost have it perfect)).  Rims are 4 lug BRM's with caps and new tires.  Everything has only 20 miles (towed....not driven). I also have a narrowed front sway bar (brand new) that need the clamps to install. Pedal cluster has been rebuilt with a classicbugparts gas, pedal and clutch arm upgrade, Shift rod has been lubed and has a new bushing and black urethane coupler installed. Needs the clutch tube welded back up (makes a sound when you push in the clutch).  \n \nINTERIOR: Black vinyl Procar Pro-90 front seats with the correct mounts. Driver seat and both seat mounts are brand new. The passenger seat is used but in excellent condition. There is no back seat. Dash is cracked but there. Door cards are there and are in good shape. Speedometer is a later unit that has been cleaned up and reset to 0 miles (not installed).  Steering wheel is a 73 Sports bug steering wheel in good shape.  Shifter is a Scat dragfast with a custom red billard ball handle. Glove box is a new ABS unit. Wiring has been somewhat cleaned up but needs to be finished up from the battery to engine. Wiring is there....you just need to feed it thru the quarter panel and into the engine bay.  \n \nENGINE/TRANSMISSION:  \n \n(2) engines available:  1- Engine is a 1600 and was from a 77 beetle.  Its been sitting for awhile but was running fine before removal.  I've had all the tin powdercoated and made a set of cylinder deflectors below the heads.  Alternator and cooling fan are brand new.  Carbs are 40 IDFs, case was full-flowed and has a 30mm oil pump, in and out cover and a CB performance 1-1/2 qt sump.  Ignition is by bosch blue coil and 009 with pertronix (electric ignition).  Heads are Los Banditos from CB performance with 40mm intake and 35mm exhaust.  Mileage on the engine is unknown and no warranty on it. \n \nThe other engine is a brand new long block 1641.  Has all new parts:  26mm oil pump, in/out cover, full-flow, resurfaced flywheel, 100 cam, new I or H beam rods, bearings and case machined to .40, and brand new stock heads.  Its was ran on the stand but either I had a bad sensor, wrong oil weight or something happened and the oil light flickered while in break-in.  It was promptly shut down and set aside.  I've not torn it down but, it cost $1400 so, you can easily get your money worth by either figuring out what is wrong, selling it or parting it out.  I will sell either 1 motor or both or none at all.   \n \nPlease note:  the billet carb filters, linkage, header and serpentine pulleys pictured are NOT included and are not optional. I have a replacement carb filter set that I will include.  The transmission is a 3:88 aka \"freeway flyer\" that was working good prior to me buying it.  The tranny mounts are german and are brand new. \n \nWill come with some new/used parts: Fender beading in black, misc seals, 2-1/2\" disc brake drop spindles (used), spare front windshield, Engine bay firewall section, Fuel tank, beetle tow bar (needs to be narrowed or bent to fit on the narrowed front beam) and a few other little odds and ends.  \n \nI have the title in my name. Car is setup on non-op with no back fees at all.  I'm willing to sell the car a few different ways....but no negotiating....prices are FIRM, no other options: \n \n-Without the motor, wheels, brake calipers, steering wheel and transmission $1000 (bring your own wheels and steering wheel) \n-Without the motor $1600 (as it sits currently) \n-With the 1641 motor (longblock only) $2000 \n-With the 1600 motor (longblock only) $2000 \n-With the 1600 motor (minus the carbs, manifolds, alternator and stand) $2200  \n-With the 1600 motor $2600 \n-With both engines $3000 \n \nTrades....I'm looking for either a 71-72 factory sunroof super or 73 thru 75 sunroof or hardtop super or 69 and up Ghia. Would like a light color car (white, tan, baby blue or yellow). MUST be factory paint....not interested in primer buckets (might consider primer if its a ghia). Don't need a motor, but must have a working transmission (or we can swap mine out).  MUST have title in your name and either non-op'd or current registration.

Its been my truck for the past year and I love it, but unfortunately have to let it go to pay some bills off.  \n \nThe truck is in great running condition. I knew the previous owner and know he took well care of the truck with on time oil changes as well as transmission flushed, as did I. Like i said, ive had it for about a year now and never had any problems. It has the Vortec 5.3L V8. Under the hood is almost spotless.  \n \nThe truck has 4 wheel drive, which is a definate plus. Always nice to have just in case. The 4x4 works great, never any issues. In regular 2 wheel drive it rides smooth, shifts smooth, and sounds great with its 30 series flowmaster exhaust.  \n \nOther random perks that come with the truck are include, a custom Rhino Lined subwoofer box fitted with 2 12\" pro comp kickers under the back seat. An aftermarket Pioneer stereo, with aftermarket speakers all the way around. The bed of the truck is Rhino Lined not only once, but twice for extra durability. It also has brand new mud terrain tires. The back three windows are tinted. \n \nLike any older truck, it does have its normal wear and tear, like the driver seat has a small rip on it, and there are minor scratches here an there.  \n \nThanks for looking, if you are interested please call or shoot me a text.

Just transferred it over to my name so I can sell the car. Was my sisters car and then handed down to me. Drove the car through high school and college and couldn't have asked for a better car to get me to and from places. Car was reliable and when ever there were any problems with the car it was fixed immediately and professionally done. Have all the paper work for proof of all the work done. \n \n PRO's  \n-Full tune up done less than 7,000 miles ago \n-Has new gaskets all around (less than 7,000 miles ago) \n-new water pump \n-new head lights (old one's fogged up) \n-Top End rebuilt when gaskets replaced \n-Smogged with all papers up to date \n-New door regulators on all 4 doors \n-oil always changed on time with ams oil full synthetic  \n-Has 3 keys (2 with keyless entry and 1'n single key) \n-Upgraded sound system \n-Factory RAM Air intake for a few extra horses \n-Factory upgraded 16'' wheels with about 80% tread left on tires \n \nCon's: \n-Normal wear and tear on exterior and interior each being about an 8/10 \n-Automatic light sensor went out.

More information about the 2014 BMW 5 Series: The BMW 5-Series stands out as a traditional luxury sport sedan that not only offers strong, uncompromised performance but also some leading-edge safety and connectivity technology. Increasingly, the 5-Series has an advantage over most of its rivals in that it offers more fuel-saving measures than most other sport sedans, with items such as Auto Start/Stop, turbocharging, direct injection and a special Eco Pro driving mode combining to provide significant gains in gas mileage. A new diesel model, the 535d, adds another way to save fuel. Otherwise, the 5-Series sedans offer more comfortable, refined cabins than some other sport sedans, and the 5-Series Gran Turismo body style is a good pick for those who want a little more cargo flexibility. Interesting features of this model are responsive handling, refined, luxurious interior, active-safety features, Eco-conscious performance, and leading-edge tech options Some used vehicles may have unrepaired safety s.

{"title": "1998 BMW E36 M3 Sedan - 5 speed,  BBS Wheels, Black Interior/Exterior", "price": "7900", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "cupertino", "description": "\n         \nTesting the waters and in no rush to sell.   \n \nClean title, 1998 BMW M3 Sedan, 5 speed in Cosmos Schwartz Metallic with black leather interior.  Rare M3 sedan with manual transmission and folding rear seats.   Car has been well cared for by both the previous owner and me since we are both enthusiasts.  It pulls hard, handles extremely well, and the interior is in excellent shape (no rips or tears on the leather). Come check it out and you will not be disappointed.  Trust me, six years ago I went to see it out of curiosity, but came away so impressed that I bought it.  Fast-forward to now and I still thoroughly enjoy it each time I drive it.  Wife prefers a newer car, but we'll see if this gets replaced. \n \nI have owned this vehicle since 2010 and have a folder full of records.  The previous owner owned it since 2001, when he bought it from eleasereturns.com.  He is an airline mechanic, so he performed all the maintenance himself, other than the clutch replacement.  He treated the car extremely well and it had tons of sentimental value to him and his wife.  He filmed me as I drove away in it.  When you see the Carfax report, you will see the clean title and two out of state stints during the previous owners ownership period (Illinois and Washington).   I verified (via LinkedIn) that both of those out of state periods corresponded with the previous owners employment history at different airlines. \n \nDuring my ownership the following has been performed: \n-\tValve cover gasket replacement twice.  10/16 was the most recent \n-\tOil changes with Mobil 1 5w-30 every 3,000 miles.  10/16 \n-\tNew NGK Laser Platinum spark plugs (BKR6EQUP 3199) for smog.  03/16 \n-\tPFC 08 Compound Racing Brake Pads (a lot of life left) & new cross-drilled rotors.  02/16 \n-\tAll fluids flushed. 02/16 \n-\tAC compressor, tensioner, and recharge 06/16 \n-\tNew shifter boot, shift bushing, driveshaft flex joint 02/16. \n-\tMichelin Pilot Super Sport tires  \n-\tCooling system overhaul with Mishimoto Radiator, new water pump, thermostat, drive belts, etc. \n-\tPioneer DEH-80PRS Deck with CD, Bluetooth, and remote.  Infinity Kappa 693.9i rear speakers. \n-\tBMW ZHP Shift knob \n-\tBMW parking brake lever \n-\tFront driver window regulator \n-\tDriver side rear door lock actuator \n-\tNew replacement front driver side wheel well plastic trim \n-\tNew front tie rods \n-\tNew front & rear windshield \n-\tNew trunk shocks \n-\tNew gear for front driver seat back adjustment \n-\tStock spare tire purchased \n-\tNew headliner \n-\tNew coin holder \n-\tDepo HID 5k headlights.  Orange Corner lights and side markers. \n-\tDime sized ding on the trunk was repaired by dentless pro. \n \nOther modifications on the car: \n-\tActive Autowerke Cold Air Intake (Stock one included) \n-\tActive Autowerke Exhaust \n-\tBMW X-Brace \n-\tBilstein Shocks \n-\tH&R Sport Springs \n-\tBBS RG-R 19x8.5 wheels \n-\tRTABs \n-\tE46 Rear Shock Mounts \n-\tNew clutch \n-\tStainless steel brake lines \n-\tTMS brake bushings \n-\tJTD Underpanel \n-\tJL Audio 600 Watt amp for speakers \n-\tMB Quart front separate speakers \n-\t10 inch Alpine Type R Sub, driven by 300 watt Alpine Amp \n-\tFan delete mod \n \nFull disclosure, so here's some additional history on the car. \n-\tMatching VIN's on all four doors, trunk, and in engine compartment.  Previous owner was never in an accident.  Only minor accident I have been in was last year.  Someone hit my rear bumper at I would say 5-10mph.  I was stopped at a light and he could not stop in time.  Very minimal damage, which insurance covered.  I have provided a picture of it in the ad.  Just the rear bumper was replaced. \n-\tI have tracked the car once in March of last year.  My first time on the track and it was through Hooked on Driving with an instructor.  Loved the car at the track and it is far more capable than what I put it through.  I had a lot of fun and plan to go to more track events but have not been able to again. \n-\tPrevious owner never tracked the car, since he took his motorcycle to the track instead.  PPI performed by Edge Motorworks when I purchased it and they confirmed it. \n-\t195,XXX miles on it currently. \n-\tOBC fully functional, as you can see from the photo provided.  No issues whatsoever. \n-\tService manual included along with spare/new parts (oil filter, relay, window washer hose, stock air intake, stock fan, and anything else I can dig up). \n-\tThere is a small leak at the steering rack, which my mechanic was comfortable having me go to the track with in March.  It's still just a small leak. \n-\tThere are rock chips on the hood and the clear coat has peeled between the headlights and kidney grills.  I have provided a picture of it.  Bought the car like this. \n-\tThere is a small door ding on the driver side rear door. \n-\tPassenger side A-Pillar interior trim is loose when an older family member reached for it thinking there was a handle. \n-\tPassenger side Angel Eye does not light up. \n-\tFog lights do not turn on.  I rarely use them.  It is not the light bulbs (PIAA yellows) and it is not the relay (have a new spare one).  \n-\tI have a replacement windshield washer hose, which I have not had time to replace. \n-\tThe sun roof tilts up (which is all I use it for), but do not open it all the way.  Otherwise you will have to crank it closed.  Bought the car like this. \n \nI am asking $7,900 or best offer.  Don't waste my time and yours.  Come take a look at the car first.  Smog and title in hand. \t \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_l9ExeXcJgn_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_g0s9iU2WqL7_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_8LxR1ge20Ew_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_hGuGJWTi1CI_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00909_u3HMkRfQ5L_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_fJzdkZq25Bx_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_5LxrF8hhXQo_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/01212_47Y27Ebdc16_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_hNDUZ7VpmRO_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_4wOzrasvjfW_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_bHsgpNmxQ4P_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_4QsRlBW6ffG_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_9s9MAICCXWS_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00909_c3MzRMg3BRC_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00h0h_cYgte5Jin1b_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00b0b_d3cJ78Lysoe_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00000_e5DLNVs6qHc_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.318000", "lng": "-122.044900", "postId": "5946746696", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/cto/5946746696.html", "postDate": "2017-01-05T10:25:00-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "1998 BMW M3 excellent 6 cylinders rwd gas 194000 black clean manual sedan", "locAccuracy": "high", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/cto/5946746696", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:53.150437", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

I've owned this car since 1995, and over the years transformed it from a humble, low performance dud to a fire breathing monster.  I have a lot of blood, sweat, and money in this car, and while it is tough to let it go, it's time for someone else to have fun with it. \n \nOriginally a 289/4speed, it now sports a supercharged, fuel injected, 331 cubic inch engine with a 5 speed manual trans.  This is not your average Mustang - this car was built for street and strip and is rediculously quick and powerful.  Everything on the car is new or restored and built with the best products on the market.  Over $60K invested, with the receipts to prove it. One ride and you'll be hooked.  It's fast, loud, reliable, and will rip your head off. There are far too many modifications to list, but here are the highlights: \n \nThe Car: \n1966 Mustang Coupe - stripped to bare metal and repainted in 2000 in Autumn Orange \nProfessionally fabricated and installed 6-point roll bar and subframe connectors \nCal-Tracs traction bars \nHeidt's Mustang II front end with tubular A-arms \nManual rack and pinion steering \nJBA Headers, 2-1/2 exhaust with x-pipe, Flowmaster 40 series mufflers \nAeromotive A1000 fuel pump, Aeromotive regulator and fuel rails \nStainless steel fuel tank by Rick's Tanks \nBudnik Fontana billet wheels -16x8 \n205/55R16 front, 225/55R16 rear BFG G-force tires \nJME Instrument panel with Autometer Sportcomp gauges \nFord EEC-IV Engine Management with TWEECER programmable module (laptop included) \nFord Racing Wiring Harness \nOptima Red top battery, trunk mounted, with shutoff switch - NHRA legal \nRear seat firewall \nFord 9\" rear with 3.50:1 gears, Detroit Locker, Strange 31-spline axles \nFront and rear disk brakes \nMSD Alternator \nMSD 7AL ignition \nAll new chrome trim, bumpers, etc.  New interior, dashpad, etc. \nBudnik steering wheel, Ididit tilt wheel steering column \nSimpson harnesses for driver and passenger \nGo-Pro camera mount on the roll bar. \n \n \nThe Engine: \n331 Ford small block, fuel injection, supercharged \nVortech S-Trim supercharger \nKeith Craft Racing Engines Short Block - Forged crank, h-beam rods, forged pistons \nMain stud support girdle with ARP fasteners \nBrodix \"Track 1\" Aluminum Heads with 2.08 Intake 1.60 Exhaust Valves and stage 2 porting \nBennet Racing custom ground Comp camshaft \nComp Camps Pro magnum roller rockers with stud girdle \nBillet Fabrications custom aluminum valve covers \nBillet Fabrications custom oil pan with windage control \n42lb/hr injectors \nARP Fasteners inside and out \nMSD Alternator \nATI Superdamper \nElectric water pump \nAN Fittings - Aeroquip hoses throughout. \n \nI could go on, there are far too many modifications to list in this ad, and I'm including extras like a wideband O2 sensor (installed), A/F ratio meter, car cover, extra rear gears, extra wheels with BFG drag radials, driveshaft loop, and more.   I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have. Just send an email if you're seriously interested in buying it. \n \nThe only thing the car needs is an emergency brake cable, available from Lokar. \n \nI've got the car tuned for plenty of power but haven't dynoed it.  With the first 302 I put in it, it ran 12s in the quarter mile on drag radials. As it sits today, with the 331, supercharger and big injectors it has now, it will easily go into the 11s (on drag radials), and possibly 10s with better tires and more tuning.  The car starts right up, is very reliable, sounds nasty, puts an evil grin on your face every time you drive it, and with more dyno time and more programming, could be even more powerful.  And it runs on pump gas. \n \nI could go on, there are far too many modifications to list in this ad.  I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have. Just send an email if you're seriously interested. \n \n \nI'm asking $42,900.  Sorry, I'm not interested in trades. Clean title, CA car. No rust ever. \n \nThanks for looking and please email if you're interested in buying it and need more information.  I'm not desparate to sell so please,  no low balling. \n \nLocated in Dublin.

I am letting it go because now I will be permanently based in California and I can finally migrate full time to an actual desktop system. \n \nI have been taking very good care of the laptop. (One could say it was babied.) It comes from a smoke-free home. The rig is well built and the internals are very easy to access (see album pictures at http://imgur.com/a/DTR9r ) should you want to upgrade any components or just clean it inside. \n \nThe panel is flawless, no dead pixels, no light bleeding on the sides. The images are vivid. (I actually like this display even more than that of my previous Alienware 17.) The keyboard and palm rest area are in excellent condition, as is the chassis. The only side that will show signs of wear is the lid -- there are some light scratches along the sculpted edges (which do not affect the laptop's functionality in any way); the laptop is black with non-reflective finish, so the mentioned cosmetic blemishes are not immediately visible. (I encourage you to look closely at all the pictures here: http://imgur.com/a/DTR9r - I tried my best to get shots with good details for you.) Also notable: the battery wear is only 3%, which means it is virtually as good as new. \n \nHere are the most relevant specs: \n \n   \nEUROCOM Sky X9 \n \n  \t\t \n17.3-inch (43.9cm); FHD IPS 1920x1080; MATTE (Non-Glare); 300nts; 700:1 \n \n \t\t \n8GB GDDR5; NVIDIA GTX 980M (N16E-GX);  ; 1536 CUDA; MXM 3.0b; 100W; \n \n  \t\t \n4GHz (up to 4.2GHz) Intel Core i7-6700K; 4C/8T; 8MB L3; Skylake-S; 14nm; LGA1151; 91W \n \n  \t\t \n16GB; 2x 8GB; DDR4; 2400Hz; CL14; 260-pin; 1.2V; Kingston HyperX Impact; 2 SODIMMs \n \n  \t \n256GB SSD; MLC; Micron M600; SATA3 6Gb/s; 7mm \n \n \t\t        \n Microsoft Windows 10 Professional; 64-bit \n \n \t \nBacklit; English; (customizable)  \n \n \t \n6-in-1 Card Reader; MMC/RSMMC/SD/MiniSD/SDHC/SDXC; UHS-II interface \n \n  \t \n2-in-1; 802.11a/b/g/n/ac WLAN + Bluetooth 4.1; Killer Wireless-AC 1525; M.2 223 \n \n \t \n2.0 Megapixels; Built-in \n \n \t \nSound Blaster X-Fi MB5; external 7.1CH audio output; headphone out, microphone in, S/PDIF and Line-in port; two built-in FORSTER Speakers (2.2W) + Subwoofer (2.5W) \n \n \t\t \n1x USB 3.1 type C (HDMI 2.0/DP 1.2/Thunderbolt 3); 2x miniDP 1.2; 1x HDMI 2.0; 5x USB 3.0 (1x Powered USB AC/DC); S/PDIF; Headphone; Mic; Line-in; 2x RJ45 (LAN) \n \n \t\t \n8-cells Smart Li-lon Battery; internal; \n \n \t\t \nWxDxH 428x308x45mm / 17.12x12.32x1.8-inch \n \n \t \n4.8kg / 10.56lbs  \n \n \t \n330 W \n \n \nAdditional features include: \n \nPrema BIOS \nTwo 1Gb LAN RJ-45 ports Killer E2400 + M.2 WLAN/Bluetooth; Killer DoubleShot X3 \nBuilt-in Fingerprint Reader \nEmbedded TPM 2.0 Security Chip for Data Encryption \nIC Diamond 7 Carat Thermal Compound cooling on CPU and GPU \n \n \n \nI would like to emphasize this model's huge selling points (at least, in my view): \n \n \n \n \ni7-6700K is already the most powerful 6th gen processor on the consumer market, yet you can squeeze even more out of it. It's all under your control given the Prema BIOS provides access to multiple very fine system tweaks. (But you do have to know what you are doing, of course!) This is an invaluable boon for all those who need the extra horsepower in CAD, CDD, or video editing applications. \n \n \n \n \nThis is not a typo -- 64 GB (4 x 16GB); this system sports 4 SODIMM sockets (all quite easy to access). If you are a gamer, then that's overkill obviously. If your line of work or hobby involves working in CAD applications with massive 3D models and animation, or DCC software such as Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Speedgrade, Illustrator, Photoshop and their multiple plugins, then 64 GB RAM is no longer a ridiculous number -- playback and rendering times even for hi-def+ content are simply unheard of on this mobile platform. \n \n \n \n \nThis will mean a lot to enthusiast gamers. I don't really play many titles, mainly DOTA 2, and to me, the G-Sync feature makes a world of difference, esp. when the game remains smooth even when I pan across very crowded battle scenes and there is no stuttering or screen tearing. I used to think G-Sync is more of a marketing thing, but it is as good as they all hailed it to be. \n \n \n \n \nThat means you can add another GPU and have two NVidia GeForce video cards in SLI. I will include the SLI cable if you wish. \n \n \n \n \nYou can migrate to a desktop GPU anytime if you so desire; although I would recommend going for the SLI 980M configuration since it is significantly more powerful than a single desktop GPU (besides, there is a mobile GPU installed already) \n \n \n \n \nOkay, whether it is for play or for work this laptop can be the cornerstone of your dream setup with all the possible ports for accommodating any needs you may have. Configuring outputs is very easy and straightforward through NVidia Control panel. \n \n \n \n \nAgain, whether you work or play, the capabilities of this new generation of SSDs are mind-boggling. Look at the stats yourselves: \nhttp://www.anandtech.com/show/7843/testing-sata-express-with-asus/4 \n \n \n \n \nThe Prema BIOS mod enables the user to customize every little thing in this system, from whether you want the manufacturer logo to appear onscreen at startup, to CPU and RAM overclocking, voltage alterations, to when to start and stop charging the battery. \n \n \nI think I could fill pages with what I like about this laptop. It is truly unique and it is not built for your mainstream user. I tried to provide as much info as possible so that you can have a better picture when you compare the different models you have in mind and all the benefits one gets you over the other. If I left any questions unanswered, please feel free to write to me and I will try to get back to you as soon as reasonably possible. \n \nHere are hi-res pics of the actual unit for sale: http://imgur.com/a/DTR9r \n \nGood luck! \n \nP.S.

{"title": "JBL Dual 15\" Speakers and QSC GX7 Amp", "price": "1499", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "san mateo", "description": "\n         \nExcellent dual 15\" JBL TR-225 Speakers, 1000W each. Come with matching QSC GX7 power amp, 1000W per side, 2000W total. One of the best sounding speakers around. They are actually 3-way: 15\" drivers are the same, but tuned differently, one for bass, one is shifted towards midrange. Because of that the transition from LF to HF is smoother, they sounds much better than a typical 2-way speaker and even some 3-way speakers. \n \nStandalone amp is much more efficient than any built-in amp module of a powered speaker. There are no size and weight restrictions, plus very efficient cooling utilizing large fan. You will never have any overheat problems common to powered speakers. FYI, large arena-sized sound systems, like JBL VerTec, consists entirely of passive speakers driven by standalone amps. They even use separate amps to drive LF and HF drivers. Passive speakers is the way to go in a pro world. \n \nPrice is for a set, two speakers and one amp. I have two of these identical sets, two amps and four speakers total, together they make an excellent main PA for a band, club, church, etc. Two speakers per side, powered from the same amp in mono mode, pretty much like powered speakers because amps are placed right next to speakers, cables are short. I carried the whole band's PA in a short body Ford Aerostar minivan: these JBLs go at the back, 4 QSC K12 monitors take the middle seat and mixer goes on a front passenger's seat. \n \nConsidering the size and sound output, you are practically getting each speaker for half of cost of similar size powered speaker (they are in $1000-plus range each, even used). You can have 4000W of raw power for under $3K (using both of my sets). None of powered speakers can match it. \n \nSpeakers are in excellent condition, can be tested any way you want. I have a mixer available to test. Since you see this ad now, it means that speakers are STILL AVAILABLE.

{"title": "Mackie DL1608 Digital Mixer with Wi-Fi Router", "price": "599", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "millbrae", "description": "\n         \nDigital mixer of the year, the ultra-compact 16-channel 8-bus Mackie DL-1608. Wireless remote control from iPad and iPhone from anywhere in the venue, ton of features that doesn't exist in other analog and digital mixers, and all this fits in a standard laptop bag! \n \n- Excellent ONYX mic preamps, the same as in ONYX-80 series large format analog mixers and ONYX recording interfaces. Accept ANY signal source, from condenser mics to line-level (keyboards, digital drums, iPhone/iPod, CD player, etc.) \n- Full digital control, including scenes memory and recall.  \n- 4-band fully parametric EQ and full dynamics suite (compressor, limiter, gate, expander) on each and every input and output. \n- Eight 31-band graphic equalizers with +/- 15dB range (more than typical 12dB), also with unique \"Draw\" feature (let you draw a desired EQ curve right on iPad, instead of moving each slider separately). \n- Two independent effects processors with all the stuff you may need for a gig: reverbs, delays, etc. \n- Channels and effects preset libraries. Real time saver, you can load typical preset like \"Kick drum\", \"Piano\", \"Guitar\", Female VOX\", etc, it gets 90% of job done, then you can tweak it to your taste. \n- Instant one-button two-track or multi-track recording straight to iPad. You can record your event as multitrack session and later polish it in a studio with any DAW (ProTools, Logic, Cubase, etc.) \n- Remote levels control from any iPhone or iPod Touch. You can let musicians dial their own monitor mixes (up to 6 independent mono mixes). This feature is a lifesaver, no more \"I can't hear myself in monitors\" or \"I need more of this and that\"). In fact you are getting a full functionality of an Aviom personal monitor mixers for free: everyone has an iPhone today, all you need is to download a free app! \n \nDL1608 can easily handle a typical 4-5 piece band gig (most bands fit into 16-channel grid, even with fully miked drum kit, and never need more than 6 separate monitor mixes). I've done plenty of cover bands with this mixer. \n \nToo many features to list here, read online reviews or download MasterFader app to your iPad and try it in demo mode, it's awesome! New version 4.0 adds bunch of new features: custom channel layers, VCAs, 6-band parametric EQ on outputs, etc. etc.  \n \nAlso watch MasterFader launch video: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yCGH5mmGaU \n \nThe most comprehensive video tutorial on DL1608 covering the latest MasterFader \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0OnElTV5oo \nIt's an hour long, but covers EVERYTHING, definitely worth watching at least once. \n \nThis is 30-pin dock version (for iPad 1 and 2). Can be used with any iPad model, from Mini to Pro (for newer iPads with Lighting connector you can use a 30-pin-to-Lighting adapter ($29 from Apple Store or around $6 on eBay), or just use Wi-Fi connection. (Note that all other iPad-controlled mixers on the market doesn't even have a dock for iPad, Wi-Fi only!). Mixer hardware is identical in both, so they sounds the same. All the sound processing is done inside of DL-1608, iPad is just the controller (also, if you'll lose Wi-Fi connection to the mixer, nothing will happen, it will still pass audio in the state it was left on). \n \nMixer is in excellent condition, everything works 100%. Selling only the mixer with power supply, iPad is shown just for illustration, how it looks together. Works with all iPad models. Comes with Linksys wireless router, all set up and ready to go. Make sure to download MasterFader app to your iPad before coming if you want to test it (it's also a good way to learn mixer in offline mode). I can test functionality with my iPad if desired. It doesn't take a lot of iPad computing power to work, so the older iPads work fine, and those are dirt cheap today ($100-130 for iPad 2, there's about 400 of them for sale on Craigslist at the moment). \n \nSince you see this ad now, it means the mixer is STILL AVAILABLE    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_1dqWhybXNK_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_8bxMoaAiTfU_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00707_1zWijiED5gb_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00808_5sBk9z0mtSK_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_h4qE1Lg8k9d_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_dnE40El0q8_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_6k7lrCH4XCl_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_bK8NFLb1UoX_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_23T9LbuLGio_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_b58DYLCBhNZ_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_lWAml0iZZW3_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.539500", "lng": "-122.299800", "postId": "5913292572", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/msg/5913292572.html", "postDate": "2016-12-10T02:31:01-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-07T00:43:16-0800", "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "highest", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/msg/5913292572", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:55.977349", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

IT MEANS IT CAN NOT BE RIDDEN ON THE STREET AS IT IS. \nYou could make it street legal, but it would take some work. \nAll DMV fees are up to date and it is under my name with a California salvage title. The bike has a non- operable registration right now with all fees for 2016 paid off. \nThis bike has never ever been raced or crashed, just taken 3/4 times to the track only. No beat up bike or abused engine /parts here. \nI just had the whole front suspension (front and back) rebuilt by catalyst reaction 3 weeks ago (I have paper work to prove it). \nIt has a new chain and sprockets, clean title, all new fluids, safety wired, go pro mounts in three places, new spark plugs, new air filter (K&N) , newer EBC double H brake pads front and rear, new front and rear galfer steel brake lines, fresh mobil 1 motor oil, K&N oil filter, new Pro factory clutch cable, new throttle cables, rebuilt carb serviced by evolution cycles and catalyst reaction with upgraded pro factory jet kit and it is painted with the Valentino Rossi theme \nWhy spending so much to sell it? Simple, I wasn't planning on selling it. \nI'm not a racer, just an enthusiast (group C, go figured). \nThis bike has been set up for the track, making it street legal would be possible, but it will take work, sometimes the work is too much and for many people is not worth it. \nI don't need money or need to sell fast, so don't bother with offers. \nI put heart and soul (and a fair amount of money) into this bike. The price is not \"sentimental value\". The bikes needs nothing and it is well priced. \nIt has a CA title(rare for track bikes) and it's CA registered \nIf it doesn't sell in a few weeks, I'll keep her as a back up bike. Have several extra parts. \nCASH ONLY. NO TRADES. \nPlease do not ask if is still available or if I want to trade it for whatever is that you have. I'm looking to downsize, otherwise I wouldn't sale it. \nDoes it still available questions will be ignored. If the ad is up, the bike still available. \nThank you for reading. \n \nKeywords, track race Yamaha Suzuki Honda r1 r6 Kawasaki aprilia Ducati sport bike    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_5U7EscAdDl_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_a1BX3a8aaON_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_7P22JacWCIQ_600x450.jpg"], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5939615709", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/mcy/5939615709.html", "postDate": "2016-12-30T21:56:38-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-07T16:12:00-0800", "attributes": "2000 Yamaha r6 excellent gas salvage manual", "locAccuracy": "medium", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/mcy/5939615709", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:06:57.854967", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

Planning to do more dirt riding so it's time to let it go. During that time I did a ton of maintenance and upgrades. It's not new or particularly pretty but it's a solid track bike with good power. Bike was down on the right side but all parts have been replaced. The mount for the frame slider is not perfectly straight but it's just cosmetic. Had the suspension rebuilt at Super Plush this year and set up for 185 pound rider (they accounted for gear weight). Can provide the paperwork showing what they did. Comes with an extra set of wheels, swingarm and box of miscellaneous parts and extras. Fresh brake fluid, water wetter, pads, oil, new battery this year, and Dunlop Q3's with some life left. I have the title but it is not in my name and not currently registered. I also have a ramp, stands, mat, hitch hauler, and EZ-UP awning if you're interested.

{"title": "Proceed AVP S Preamp Processor  $475 obo", "price": "475", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "vallejo / benicia", "description": "\n         \nI'm selling a used great condition Proceed AVP S Preamp Processor. This unit sounds and works great. Includes remote. \n \nOriginal MSRP $4995. Asking $475obo \n \nPlease call or text if interested \n  \n \n \nThe Proceed AVP is a full function audio/video preamp that combines audio preamplification, digital conversion, broadcast-quality video switching and surround sound decoding into a highly refined high-end gem. Priced at $4,995 (S-Video version), the Proceed AVP comes equipped with DTS, AC3, Pro Logic, THX and numerous other surround fields for both music and video playback. The digital section of the AVP uses Burr Brown 1702 20-bit Multibit DACs for the left and right channels and 1-bit, 24-bit compatible AKM Delta-Sigma DACs for the center, surround, aux and subwoofer channels. A dealer-provided software update will be available in the near future to get your AVP ready for the 24-bit 96 kHz performance. \n \nThe AVP comes equipped with seven digital and eight analog highly flexible, assignable inputs. A special version of the AVP can be ordered in order to take up to four S-VHS inputs, as well as four composite inputs. A standard AVP comes with six composite video inputs. During the set-up process, you decide which audio and or video device is to go into what input. For example, you can set the primary and secondary input method; a DVD player would take a digital input first and possibly an analog second. The set-up process is not a cakewalk, but it is logical and intuitive. The AVP manual is among the best I have ever read, in that it is complete and easy to understand for the end user. \n \nThe faceplate of the Proceed AVP has a non-traditional design that incorporates a sexy modern look with useful buttons in unconventional placements. The controls for the loudspeaker level adjusters are curved around the beautifully milled volume knob. This makes lots of sense in that the volume knob has a dual purpose: it also controls the surround parameters when desired. \n \nThe design for the Proceed AVP's remote is unique in that, unlike its competitors, it fits easily in your hand and features only nine buttons. Each button is within reach of your thumb for both left- and right-handers. The three main buttons toggle up and down smoothly. However, I frequently found myself making the mistake of switching my inputs when I wanted to lower the volume. Ultimately, I added a hand-held touch screen remote to control every component in my system, as well as to facilitate macros.   \n \nConclusion  \n \nThe Proceed AVP is the best value in all of the AV preamps. At $4995, it is far from cheap, but it has all of the features and high-end performance you'd expect from a Madrigal product; you would need to spend upwards of $15,000 to get anything comparable elsewhere. The fit and finish is great and the ease of use is much better than average. As a two-channel preamp, the Proceed AVP could replace nearly all of the existing preamps on the market even if you saved the surround features for future home theater upgrades. The Proceed AVP is a home run of a product. You'll be proud to own one as the centerpiece of your high performance multi-media system.    \n \n \nSpecifications \n \u25a0 Frequency response: \n\u25a0 Total harmonic distortion: \n\u25a0 Maximum output (XLR): \n\u25a0 Maximum output (RCA): \n\u25a0 Dynamic range: \n\u25a0 Signal to noise ratio (balanced outputs): \n\u25a0 Channel separation: \n\u25a0 Analog filter: \n\u25a0 Low-level linearity: \n\u25a0 Volume range: \n\u25a0 Volume resolution: \n\u25a0 Digital inputs: \n\u25a0 Analog inputs: \n\u25a0 RF Demodulator input: \n\u25a0 Digital input impedance: \nDigital output: \n\u25a0 Main analog outputs: \n\u25a0 Analog output impedance: \n\u25a0 Available trigger current: \n\u25a0 Power consumption: \n\u25a0 Mains voltage: \n\u25a0 Mains frequency: \n\u25a0 Overall dimensions: \n10\u03a9 80 mA per outlet less than 50 W 100V, 120V, 200V, 230V, 240V, factory set for destination country only 50 or 60 Hz, factory set for destination country only See \"Dimensions\" 34 lbs.

{"title": "fits 5'4\"-5'8\" 46cm 2015 Fuji Tread 1.0 Disc Road Cyclecross Bike", "price": "500", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "emeryville", "description": "\n         \nI'm selling my nearly-new Fuji because my SO keeps building me custom bikes this go-anywhere bike is ready to find a new home. Forget what the bike shop guy told you your size is, this is a cyclecross bike and built  for someone between 5'4\" and 5'9\". I am 5'4 and I have really had to work to make my body fit the long geometry. Here are the details that make her worth every penny of $500 (listing price $1500), despite the admittedly lame way that the paint has chipped. \n \n1. Disc brakes. That means you can hitch on the trailer or baby bike seat and feel totally comfortable in all weather, any hill, no problem. They are perfectly tuned up, but if you want, I am happy to give you the free tune up card I have from Performance Bicycles.  \n2. Basically brand new tires. These are cyclocross tires, which means that they are skinny enough to fly down the roads, but beefy enough that you can conquer Oakland or Mission Street (or trails, which is what they were meant for) and not feel like you are taking your life in your hands.  \n3. This bike is waaaayyyy lighter than a touring bike but does the same job. Go camping, go off road, across the country, up the two flights of stairs to your place or on bart. The frame can handle it and picking it up is a breeze.  \n4. Because of my size, I upgraded the handlebar stem to a Ritchie fully adjustable stem ($50). You can adjust to make the exact position that is right for you.  \n5. Shimano clip-in combo petals. Wear your street shoes, wear your biking shoes, no problem and a great low profile. ($75) \n6. Topeak rear rack. Yes, this bike is so light-yet-beefy, you will want to haul things around. ($35) \n7. It isn't stolen! Your karma is safe and the bottom bracket numbers are fully intact.  \n \n \n \n \nStraight from the horse's mouth:  \nBuilt for the road less traveled, the Fuji Tread 1.0 disc road bike is perfectly at home on pavement, gravel, dirt, and everything in between. Exclusive to Performance, the Tread 1.0 mates a durable and lightweight aluminum frameset to premium components for a go-anywhere, do anything adventure machine. The Fuji A6-SL custom-butted alloy frame is light enough to ride on the road, but durable enough for the dirt, and features huge tire clearances so you can run whatever rubber you need to get the job done. A carbon fiber fork keeps things smooth and the gram count low. Shifting falls to Shimano's excellent redesigned 105 5800 11-speed components. Benefitting from a flood of trickle down technology from the pro-level Dura-Ace and Ultegra groups, 105 has gotten refined ergonomics, improved shifting performance, and an extra gear so you always have the right one. Tektro mechanical disc brakes give you plenty of braking power and control, on all kinds of terrain and in all-weather conditions. Big, wide 700x35 super premium X'Plore tires from Clement give you flat protection and a smooth, supple road feel that'll keep you rolling from rough city streets to some deep and chunky gravel.

No Texting. \n \nYOU CAN PURCHASE A BOGEN TRIPOD FOR $60-80 AND A BOGEN TRIPOD HEAD FOR $40-60, WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS. \n \nPictures of some of the tripods and heads here (80% down the page): https://picasaweb.google.com/109461270735919351553/Tripods?authkey=Gv1sRgCKzpg-K6keeiAg&noredirect=1 \n \nPictures of Lights and other Video and Photography Equipment here (80% down the page): https://picasaweb.google.com/109461270735919351553/6294368780437231665?authkey=Gv1sRgCMHKw7G3gYHt9QE \n \nTRIPOD SIZES. I categorize the most common portable Tripods into 2 sizes.  \nMEDIUM (approximately 46\" height with the center column down and 54\" maximum height with center column extended and 22\" folded) would work for someone 5'6 and smaller and  \nLARGE (53\" height with center column down and 67\" maximum height with center column extended and 26\" folded) which would work for somebody 6' or taller.  \nThe height of the tripod dimension is measured with the legs in the standard spread position, from the top of the metal disc that the head would attach to, to the ground. Add approx 4\"-6\" when the head is attached and an additional 3\"-6\" when you attach the camera. \n \nMost Bogen tripods will work with most Bogen heads available since they are interchangeable. You can convert a screw on mount to a quick release mount for $33 by buying the \"Manfrotto 323 RC2 Rapid Connect Adapter with 200PL-14 Quick Release Plate\" on Amazon shown here: http://www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-323-Connect-Adapter-200PL-14/dp/B001ASU1QO \n        \nBogen Tripods and Monopod.

This head can be used with the 808M power supply, where maximum power is required on a single lamphead. It operates with all Norman Series 500 power supplies including the P404, P808M, P808M/TLC and P808-1200/TLC. Its features include a high-impact resin housing that won't dent or scratch, and a modeling lamp off-on switch. \nNote - Fan cooling is required when cutting off the air flow through the lamphead with gel filters, grid, or softboxes. The head is available with a fan (LH500BP) for more demanding applications. A power supply for this flash head is required. \n-Light Norman LH500+ 132406.

It operates on all Norman Series 500 power supplies, including the P404, P808M, P808M/TLC and P808-1200/TLC. It features include a high-impact resin housing that won't dent or scratch, and a modeling lamp off-on switch. \nNote - Fan cooling is required when cutting off the air flow through the lamphead with gel filters, or softboxes. The R9124 Rapid Cool Blower can be added for these situations. A power supply for this flash head is required. \n \nPhotos here: https://picasaweb.google.com/m/viewer#album/109461270735919351553/6279003904879520945. \n \n3 Norman C1000 lights with 3 power cords plus one additional power cord (a total of 4), 3 light stands, 3 light hoods, 4 bulbs, carry/storage bag, good condition.

To complete the set, you will need to purchase about $100 in parts. If purchased new, this could cost you about $945. You save about 60% off new online price. Pictures. \n \nOne of the light housing has a 2\" crack on it which does not affect its use. \n \nHere is what you need to completely renew the set. For less than around $150 in replacement parts, you can have a $945 lighting set for 55% off new prices. $450 versus $945. \n-2 new umbrellas can be purchased for about $20 each here: http://www.adorama.com/nmac1000.html \n-new bulbs cost $50 or less for the 350 & 650 watt combined. You probably can order them for less. \n-new domes cost: $20 each x 3 pieces? \n-4 fuses: $5 or less. \n \nEND OF AD. \n \n-Bogen Manfrotto 3001BN Black tripod with the Bogen 3030 Photo head. $40 for the tripod only and $30 for the head only. The head needs a quick release camera plate which can be purchased on ebay for less than $10 and a nut and bolt for one of the legs. See pictures. Because part of the tripod legs are bent, if you plan on using it for studio use only and don't need to collapse it, this would be a good choice. \n \nIf you are missing some parts and need them immediately, I may be able to sell those parts.  \n \nAlameda, CA \nFive one zero.

Bought her an automatic instead and kept this one thinking I would use it myself for ranch work which never happened. The quad doesn't even have an hour on the motor. To top it off, I changed out the stock battery (because I believe they aren't that good) as well as the stock chain with a heavier duty one (for the same reason, stock chains aren't that great). After changing those things out we only used the other quad we had and the wife's new one. This one has simply sat, with brand new battery, brand new chain, brand new ties, brand new everything only to have the tank drained of old gas and fired up once a month to keep the motor new and turning.  \n \nAlso installed a battery tender (which is plugged in always) and will give it to the new owner. The 250 quads are over 2K brand new, and this one hasn't been taken off road or worked at all, super clean.  \n \nThis ATV also COMES REGISTERED OFF ROAD READY (STICKERS AND ALL) through June 2017! No need to hit the DMV and go through the off road registration BS you will need to buying from other sellers on Craigslist. Trust me, you do not want to be stopped by the county sheriff 's or Fish & Game with out having the CA off road legit stickers/registration, it is bad news! This QUAD is READY TO GO! -PINK IN HAND- \n \nPro's: Everything is brand new (Look at the pics: no dirt on the tires, shocks, anything). Has headlights, tail light, brake lights, high beams, low beams, front rack and a back rack. Perfect for ranching or a bit of fun. Come start'er up and see for yourself!  \n \nCon's: Small crack in the front plastic grill guard from the wife driving/loading it in to the pick up (hence why she doesn't want a clutch) which can be seen in the pic, low left facing the quad. \n \n$1,500 OBO - No reasonable offer will be refused CASH IS KING!

{"title": "Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H55 14.1MP Digital Camera with 10x Wide Angle Opti", "price": "120", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "san jose north", "description": "\n         \nSony Cyber-shot DSC-H55 14.1MP Digital Camera with 10x Wide Angle Optical Zoom with SteadyShot Image Stabilization and 3.0 inch LCD (Black)  \n \n \n3.0-inch Clear Photo LCD display (230k pixels) \n Compose and show off your images on the large 3.0-inch (230K) Clear Photo LCD display, which features a special anti-reflective coating for sharp visibility, even in bright sunlight.  \n \n10x (25mm-equivalent) professional-quality optical zoom G-Lens \n G lenses are used in top of the line digital single lens reflex (DSLR) cameras and advanced pro-sumer HD camcorders. Capture the action up close with the 10x optical zoom, and with the 25mm equivalent wide angle lens the H55 even allows you to capture more of the scenes in landscape or group portraits.  \n \n14.1-megapixel Super HAD CCD image sensor \n A powerful 14.1-megapixel, 1/2.3-inch Super HAD CCD image sensor helps you capture gorgeous images with superb contrast and clarity down to the finest detail. With 14.1 megapixels, you can create stunning, photo-quality prints up to A3+ (13 x 19\") size, or crop your images and still come away with high resolution shots.  \n \nSweep Panorama mode \n Reach beyond the traditional wide angle lens, and capture more breathtaking shots with Sweep Panorama Mode. Simply press the shutter button and sweep the camera horizontal or vertically and the camera continuously shoots at a high speed, then seamlessly stitches the images together with automatic position adjustment to create one stunning panoramic image. Available in wide and ultra-wide options, the camera can take panoramic shots of up to 243 degrees. Now capturing wide landscapes is as easy as press and sweep.  \n \n \n720p HD MP4 Movie Mode \n 720p MP4 is a popular format for high definition video that compresses the size of your audio and video, making your media files small enough to easily transfer to your compatible PC or Mac. MP4 is also highly compatible with the Web, so you can effortlessly upload your media to popular photo or video-sharing Web sites like Photobucket or YouTube. (Compatible PC with internet capability required).  \n \nBIONZ Image Processor \n The BIONZ image processor delivers the high resolution and fast performance you expect from a Sony digital camera. Fast processing enables unique Sony features such as Sweep Panorama, Handheld Twilight, Antimotion Blur, HDR, etc to take and combine multiple images in less than a second to create wide panoramic images. Images have reduced grain and appear less washed out.  \n \n \nSelf-Portrait Timer \n Self-Portrait Timer helps take the guesswork out of self portraits by utilizing Face Detection technology to recognize when your face enters the frame. Once the camera detects your face, it triggers a 2-second timer, and then snaps a picture.  \n \nIntelligent Auto (iAuto) mode \n Unlike traditional auto mode, Intelligent Auto (iAuto) mode thinks for you, recognizing scenes, lighting conditions, and faces, and adjusts settings resulting in clearer images, faces with more natural skin tone, and less blur. By incorporating advanced features such as Intelligent Scene Recognition, Face Detection technology, and Optical SteadyShot image stabilization, iAuto mode lets you take advantage of the latest Sony Cyber-shot technology without leaving auto mode. Whether you're shooting landscapes, capturing a beautiful flower, or taking pictures at an in-door birthday party or wedding shower, iAuto mode will optimize your camera's settings to help ensure you come away with a great shot.  \n \nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode \n Intelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects eight different types of scenes and, within just 1/30th of a second, selects the appropriate camera settings: Backlight, Backlight Portrait, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Twilight using a tripod, Portrait, Landscape, and Macro. iSCN has two modes: Auto and Advanced. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advanced Mode, the camera takes a photo with the optimal settings and, if in difficult lighting (low light or back light) immediately takes a second photo with another optimized setting so you can choose which to keep.  \n \nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization \n Optical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically compensates to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality.  \n \nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization w/ Active Mode \n Optical SteadyShot image stabilization with Active Mode gives you the freedom to shoot movies even while walking or running. By providing up to 10x the correction of standard mode, Active Mode can compensate for excessive camera shake so you can move along with your subject while shooting.  \n \nHigh Sensitivity Mode (ISO 3200) \n High ISO allows for faster shutter speed, so you can take photos indoors or in low light without the need for a flash. In addition to High Sensitivity Mode (ISO), you can select up to seven ISO settings (Auto, 80, 100, 200, \n  \n 3200) when shooting in Program Auto Mode to adjust sensitivity to your shooting conditions.  \n \nFace Detection technology \nSony's Face Detection technology can automatically distinguish between children and adults. Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts flash, focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends.  \n \nMotion Detection \n Motion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces.  \n \nAnti-blink Function \n It's frustrating to think you've captured that perfect shot, only to review it later and discover one of your subjects blinked just as you pressed the shutter. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting or blinking. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot.  \n \nSmile Shutter technology \n Smile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can be used together with Smile Shutter mode. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting.  \n \nDynamic Range Optimizer Standard and Plus \n Dynamic Range Optimizer (DRO) Standard and Plus uses a sophisticated algorithm to help recover shadows and highlights. The result is more natural images with clearer details that more closely match what your naked eye sees. DRO is particularly effective when shooting backlit portraits or any scene with a dramatic contrast between background and foreground lighting. DRO Plus allows for even greater optimization by analyzing each region of an image and performing additional image processing.  \n \nIntelligent AF \n Thanks to Intelligent AF technology, capture fleeting moments like a child's adorable expression with the ultra-quick AF which locks focus in as little as 0.3-sec.  \n \nScene modes \n The DSC-H55 features 11 convenient scene modes: High Sensitivity, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Soft Snap, Landscape, Beach, Snow, Fireworks, Advanced Sports, Gourmet, Pet.  \n \nEasy Shooting Mode \n With Easy Shooting Mode, even beginners can take great photos. In Easy Shooting Mode, easy-to-understand basic instructions are displayed on the LCD screen and the camera switches to all automatic settings, removing several function choices and allowing you to focus on just your subject. Since this mode works together with Intelligent Scene Recognition, the camera selects the optimum setting for each scene. In addition the easy mode simplifies preview mode.  \n \nFunction Guide \n This beginner-friendly optional function helps navigate through the various functions and settings displaying the description of chosen functions or settings on the LCD screen.  \n \nPHOTOMUSIC \n PHOTOMUSIC combines images with music (4 tracks, 5 minutes per track) to produce fun and entertaining slide shows with standard visual effects (Simple, Nostalgic, Active, and Stylish). Select from pre-loaded tracks on the camera or transfer your own from your compatible computer (sold separately).  \n \nViewing modes \n Find your photos using the simple folder or calendar viewing modes.  \n \nIn-Camera retouching tools \n Retouch and enhance your photos on the go with in-camera Trimming, Red-Eye Correction, and Unsharp Masking functions.  \n \n \nPhotoTV HD \n Bring your photos to life and enjoy highly detailed, high definition images with PhotoTV HD-capable Sony BRAVIA HDTVs. PhotoTV HD fine tunes settings on your PhotoTV HD enabled BRAVIA HDTV, such as sharpness, gradation, and color to display images that look more like printed photos.  \n \nLithium-ion battery \n Included lithium-ion battery provides added convenience with longer lasting power than alkaline batteries (capacity of supplied battery is 310 images or 155 minutes for shooting still images). Additional battery available for purchase add more power and information  \n \nMedia card slot  \nFor convenient storage and sharing of your images, the DSC-H55 accepts Memory Stick Duo/Memory Stick PRO Duo/Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo media (sold separately) or SD/SDHC media (sold separately).  \n \nSD Card Functionality \n Sony SD memory cards are the perfect solution for storing and sharing your digital content such as high-quality photos, videos, music, and more.  \n \nIncludes : original battery, 2 brand new after market batteries, after market travel(car&wall) charger  \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_g3KgA5iNvG7_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00B0B_8e5OLyg8vlr_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_257z2wonUAm_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_dQuS8z5nJEQ_600x450.jpg"], "lat": "37.403100", "lng": "-121.858500", "postId": "5922507243", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/pho/5922507243.html", "postDate": "2016-12-16T17:59:41-0800", "updateDate": "2017-01-09T19:17:13-0800", "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "highest", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/pho/5922507243", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:07:03.165825", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "BOB Yak tow-behind bike trailer for bike touring", "price": "150", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "bernal heights", "description": "\n         \nThinking about bike touring? This is an amazing gear choice. Mix it with a Northface Basecamp Duffel and you have a complete gear set. The trailer is not the lightest option, and can make those hills a little bit tougher to get up. I'm a strong cyclist, and as a result it worked great for me. The downhill will be unlike anything else available though. It tracks behind the bike way smoother than the pannier option.  \n \nCon - heavier than panniers (not a lot though once you get done with front and rear racks) \nPro - One bag (some people like having 5 little bags) that can hold larger items easy. No longer strapping tent poles to the top tub that chafes while you ride... \nPro - Downhill bliss - I hit 55 mph with this thing (not the smartest idea btw, but amazing. That gives you an idea how great the ride is) \nCon - not easy to put on a plane - doable though \n \nWhy am I selling it? First kid on the way, storing this just doesn't make sense for us. Being a gear-junky, letting this piece go is a bit tough. Hope someone else can enjoy it.  \n \nFrom the manufacturer: \nOur first BOB trailer set the standard for all others to come: tough, dependable and ready to roll wherever life moves you. The Yak Trailer carries up to 70 pounds of what you need to ride longer and further. It attaches to most bicycles' rear wheel hub, creating a low and stable center of gravity with excellent aerodynamics.   \nhttp://www.bobgear.com/bike-trailers/yak    ", "imageUrls": [], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5953445458", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/bik/5953445458.html", "postDate": "2017-01-10T09:45:37-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "BOB Yak", "locAccuracy": "medium", "sellerUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/bik/5953445458", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-13 08:07:05.883923", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

{"title": "2016 Lynskey R240 Titanium Disc Road Bike", "price": "3200", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "alameda", "description": "\n         \nHey folks, \n \nI'm regretfully selling my 2016 Lynskey Titanium R240 disc road bike (in size small) with the latest Shimano Ultegra hydraulic disc brakes that I built up earlier this year but have not had time to ride.  This was my dream bike build and I spent copious amounts of money, time researching and building up the bike.  It has the latest road bike tech included ( disc brakes, tapered head tube, tapered carbon steerer/fork, 135mm rear spacing, etc).  You can also convert this bike to the latest thru-axle technology to really stiffen up the ride,  basically this frame is future proofed (atleast for now).  I'm 5'6\" and this bike should comfortably fit someone between 5'3\"-5'9\" depending on your proportions. \n \nThe bike only has approx. 100 miles on it and everything is in excellent condition.  This bike rides soooo smooth, fast, nimble and the power goes straight to the wheels.  I've ridden carbon road bikes in the past and titanium really is the way to go as it's stiff and takes out all of the harshness/noises (carbon creaks) in the ride that carbon has.  The hydraulic disc brake stopping power is insanely better than mechanical discs or rim brakes.  Titanium frames will last a lifetime, if you crash/drop/knick/ding/breathe on your bike, you don't have to worry about cracks like carbon bikes. \n \nHere's the specs: \n \nFrame:  2016 Lynskey R240 Disc titanium frame \nFork:  Lynskey Pro Carbon #3 disc fork/Cane Creek 40 1.5\" tapered headset \nHeadset:  Cane Creek 40 1.5\" tapered headset \nFront Derailleur:  Shimano Ultegra 6800 34.9 clamp-on front derailluer \nRear Derailleur:  Shimano RD-6800, Ultegra GS 11-spd \nCrankset:  Shimano Ultegra 6700 Compact 50/34T crankset (this is the only slightly used part of the entire build, has 400 miles on the crank) \nCassette/Freewheel:  Shimano CS-6800, Ultegra, 11-spd, 11-32T \nBottom Bracket:  Shimano BBR60 Ultegra Bottom Bracket \nShifters:  Shimano shifter/brake levers, ST-RS685 2x11 Speed \nChain:  Shimano CN-HG700-11, FOR 11-spd (road/mtn) \nBrakes Calipers:  Shimano Disc-brake BR-RS785 \nBrake Levers:  Shimano integrated ST-RS685 Hydraulic \nBrake Rotors:  Shimano SM-RT76 XT 160MM, 6-bolt \nHandlebar:  Giant Contact, 31.8 (40cm) \nStem:  Easton ea90 100mm \nSeat Post:  Specialized 25mm offset 27.2 x 400mm Seatpost \nRims:  Vuelta Corsa Lite DR Disc Road Wheelset (tubeless compatible) \nTires:  Contintental Grand sport race 700x25c tires \n \nThe bike will not come with a saddle or pedals as these are rider specific but i'll have pedals/saddle installed for the test ride.  i'd like for it to go to a good home where it'll be ridden, idolized and appreciated! \n \n \nI'm asking $3200 cash firm, it cost me alot more to build (the frame alone is $2100!).  Please only email me if you're seriously interested and willing to pay my asking price in cash.  Collateral (Car keys, wallet or credit card) will be required before any test rides will be granted.  We'll meet in a public, well-lit location that's safe for both parties.   \n \nNO LOWBALLERS, SCAMMERS OR TIREKICKERS!!!  IF THE AD IS STILL UP THEN THE BIKE IS STILL FOR SALE.  NO PARTING OUT.

This is the Traditional Plus model that is the same as the Gibson Les Paul Standard up until they started chambering the Standard in 2007, it is NOT the cheaper version \"Traditional Pro\" made for Guitar Center without a nitro finish, chambered, lower grade maple tops, etc.   \n \nThe electronics have been upgraded with a RS Guitar Works vintage 50s wiring kit and DiMarzio 36th Anniversary PAF-style pickups.  Incredible, classic tone and responsiveness from the controls! \n \nWeighs less than 9.1 pounds on the post office scale.  \n \nI bought this as a backup for my 1959 Historic Reissue but can't justify having both guitars, so I've put both up for sale and will keep the one that doesn't sell. In order for it to look more like a 1959 burst, the speed knobs were replaced with amber tophats, \"poker chip\" and switch tip swapped for more vintage colored plastic, and the \"Traditional\" truss rod cover replaced with a blank one.  The original hardware is still in the case.    \n \nTremendous feel and tone, the guitar is well set-up and ready to go!  There are some minor scratches from a belt buckle on the back that were hard to photograph, and two dings on the rear of the headstock  that are not visible from the front and don't affect the guitar in any way other than cosmetically.  I don't know how the dings happened, as they were there when I bought the guitar.   \n \nEmail, call, or text Eric at nine 7 0 - two three 7 - 9 8 two two.

Kit is complete except for the 4 AA batteries. It was bought some time ago, but never used. Batteries were removed due to age.  \n \nFor shopping centers, industrial complexes, college campuses, condominiums, and other expansive sites. If a remote control is going to work it needs the power to cover long-range distances. The ICR has a signal strong enough to go through obstructions such as buildings, walls, or trees and communicate with a controller for a half mile or more. When nothing is in its path, the ICR can function up to two miles from the controller. The ICR is a single unit that can be carried from job to job and used to remotely access dozens of di\ufb00erent irrigation systems (including any Hunter controller that operates with a SmartPort system). That eliminates going back and forth to the controller to start or stop a cycle during maintenance or installation. The task of winterizing a system becomes a one-person job instead of two.  \n \nFeatures:  \n\u00b7 Over \u00bd mile typical range. Control sprinklers, valves, and pumps without going directly to the controller.  \n\u00b7 Compatible with all Hunter controllers. Designed to work with all Hunter ICC, Pro-C and SRC controllers through a SmartPort connection.  \n\u00b7 Large LCD display, push button operation. User-friendly features make the remote simple to use.  \n\u00b7 Variable remote activated station run times. Allows a one-time change in station run time duration without affecting the regular program.  \n\u00b7 Operates on 4 AA batteries for up to a year. Automatic shutoff extends battery life when not in use.  \n\u00b7 128 different programmable security codes. Allows multiple ICR receivers to be used in the same area.  \n\u00b7 Rugged plastic carrying case.

While the bottles sought are sometimes broken, these stoppers remain. Each has a beer logo on it from a defunct pre-prohibition brewery.  With the invention of the metal bottle cap, these stoppers became obsolete and scarce. Prohibition started in 1919. These are all from before this, possibly from the late 1800's. They are at least 96 years old, possibly 115 years old. They are in good condition for their age. The price is $10 each - your choice. The actual breweries on the stoppers may be different from the pictures as they sell. \n \nI have a significant collection of beer collectibles such as lighted /metal / plastic / cardboard signs, mirrors, tap handles / knobs, glass/ glasses, steins, mugs, beer cans, coasters, posters, labels, bottles, bottle caps, trays, match book covers, labels, openers, etc. Budweiser / Bud Light / Lite, Miller, Coors, Hamms, Sierra Nevada, Schlitz, St. Pauli Girl, Olympia, Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR), Heineken, etc. - both domestic (USA) and foreign: German / Germany, England / Great Britain / United Kingdom (UK) / Scotland / Ireland, Japan, China, Russia, Italy, etc.  \n \nIf it advertised beer, I probably have it.  \n \nLet me know if you're looking for something.

{"title": "Gibson USA Les Paul Traditional Pro II  Fralin pickups", "price": "1250", "priceUnit": "$", "cityName": "sunnyvale", "description": "\n         \nHoney burst finish is beautiful!  excellent cosmetically, one small body ding only and a very slight residue from a decal that was on the body (photos do not capture)  Amazing tone with boutique Fralin humbucker pickups!  this LP stays in tune better than any I have ever had, and I have had close to 10 over the years.  I have moved to single coil guitars, so this must go!  Come check it out, it will be going on ebay soon.  50s neck is very comfortable, not too big, but no hand cramps like smaller necks..   2013 model year.  \n \nhttp://www.guitarcenter.com/Gibson/Les-Paul-Traditional-Pro-II-50s-Neck-Electric-Guitar.gc \n \nTaking design and visual cues from the Les Pauls of the '80s and '90s, the Les Paul Traditional Pro II features powerful pickups with push/push for coil splits and boost circuit, '50s neck profile, Grover locking tuners, antique binding, period-correct pickguard, vintage Gibson top hat knobs, and the revolutionary Plek set up. \n \nWith all the fat, sweet, snarling Les Paul tone that purists love, the new Gibson Les Paul Standard Traditional Pro II sports a mahogany body with a thick maple cap for the perfect blend of warmth and clarity. The top is finished in high-gloss lacquer, while the back, sides, and neck have a smooth satin finish that feels great and lets the wood resonate fully. Each Les Paul Traditional also comes with Gibson USA's standard black snakeskin case. \n \nno Period-Correct Pickguard \n \n \nstock Pickups: Neck - '57 Classic; Bridge - Super '57 \nAmong the qualities that make Gibson's original \"Patent Applied For\" humbucking pickups so unique are the subtle variations between coil windings. For the first few years of their productions\u201a\u00c4\u00ee1955 to 1961\u201a\u00c4\u00eeGibson's PAF humbuckers were wound using imprecise machines, resulting in pickups with slightly different output and tone. The '57 Classic and Super '57 pickups are the result of Gibson's drive to capture and recreate this characteristic. Introduced in 1992, the '57 Classic at the neck provides warm, full tone with a balanced response, packing that classic Gibson PAF humbucker crunch, inspired by those original PAFs that received a few extra turns of wire. The Super '57 bridge pickup debuts in the Trad Pro with a wider frequency response and increased output. \n \nBoth are made by Gibson to the exact same specs as the original PAFs, including Alnico II magnets, nickel-plated pole pieces, nickel slugs, maple spacers, and vintage-style, 2-conductor braided wiring. Gibson added poly-coated wiring, which improves consistency by eliminating thick or thin spots on the wiring, and wax potting, which removes all internal air space and any chance of microphonic feedback. \n \nBoth pickups offer coil splitting for single-coil sounds and a boost circuit via push/push switching in the volume controls. \u201a\u00c4\u00faStraight Split\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 coil-splitting offers pure single coil tone and differs from LP Standards and Studios that have a \u201a\u00c4\u00faSuper Tap\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 coil-tap, which still has a small amount of humbucking. The boost circuit has a user-adjustable 10-dB boost for added power and frequency range for solos, single-note picking and dirty chording (depending on amp settings) and features true bypass that disengages the boost completely, ensuring pure passive Les Paul tone. \n \nRevolutionary Plek Set Up \nThe Les Paul Traditional is the first model from Gibson USA to utilize the revolutionary Plek machine in setting up the guitar. The Plek is a German-made, computer-controlled machine that carefully measures each fret, along with the fingerboard height under each string, and then automatically dresses each fret, virtually eliminating string buzz and greatly improving the overall playability of the guitar. This pioneering process does in minutes what it takes a luthier several hours\u201a\u00c4\u00eesometimes even days\u201a\u00c4\u00eeto accomplish. Every fret is accurately aligned, and the guitar is properly intonated, leaving the instrument \"Plek'd\" and amazingly playable. \n \nAntique Binding \nTo see the process of putting the binding on the Les Paul Traditional is to really appreciate the effort and attention that Gibson puts into each instrument. A lone craftsman will carefully glue and fit 2 pieces of binding around the entire body of a Les Paul. He then winds a single, very long piece of narrow cloth around the entire body until the entire surface is nearly covered. The body is then hung to dry for a full 24 hours before it is unwrapped and moved into the next phase of production. It has been done the same way for over 100 years. Some question the value of adding binding, but Gibson believes it is a fundamental part of our rich guitar-making history. The binding adds elegance to the Les Paul Standard, and helps protect the edges of the body.

I have other computers available that you can view by clicking on the \"more ads by this user\" box and even some that aren't listed on Craigslist yet so feel free to ask if you're looking for something else. I can also do custom orders as well such as installing dual hard drives, making fusion drives, upgrading ram, etc.  \n \n \nThis specific model was the last \"Unibody\" design made by Apple where the components are user replaceable instead of soldered onto the logic board like the new Retina models. I have installed a new 1,000 GB (1 TB) Samsung hard drive, maxed the ram out to 16 GB, removed the DVD drive to install a secondary 256 GB SSD and to top it all off the two hard drives are recognized as a single \"Fusion\" drive by the computer. This means the computer itself will automatically manage what files go on which hard drive so that the operating system, programs and files you use the most are available in an instant and load up to 10 times faster than a traditional hard drive! The battery is also brand new with only about 4 cycles on it, and since they're designed to last for at least 1,000 cycles you'll find years of use without issue! Everything is working perfectly including all ports and peripherals like camera, microphone, bluetooth and keyboard. The computer is in excellent condition with normal wear and tear but nothing major like a dented corner or water damaged components. You're more than welcome to test everything out before purchasing and I'd be happy to help you make sure everything is in tip top shape.  \n \n \n \nMacBook Pro 15\", Mid 2012 \n- 2.3 GHz Intel i5 Processor  \n- 16 GB 1600 MHz RAM \n- 1,000 GB HD \n- 256 GB SSD \n- 1536 MB Intel HD Graphics 4000 \n- 512 MB NVIDIA  \n- 4 Cycles! (Battery is rated for 1,000 cycles before it begins to fail) \n- USB 3.0 \n- Boots in under 20 seconds \n- Read/Write speeds between 400-500 mb/sec \n- Brand new charger and extension cord along with manuals \n \nThis computer also comes with the latest version of macOS Sierra along with $3,000 in new, licensed software such as the full Adobe CS6 Suite which includes 17 fully licensed, working programs like Photoshop CS6, After Effects CS6, Illustrator CS6, Indesign CS6 and more. It also comes with the newest versions of Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro X, Screenflow and Microsoft Office 2016. \n \nI am asking for $900 cash, no credit cards, PayPal, checks, shipping or trades. I can also provide a proof of sale at the time of purchase. \n \nPRICE IS FIRM. \n \nFeel free to call or text me at \n  \nand please tell me which computer you are interested since I have other computers listed as well.

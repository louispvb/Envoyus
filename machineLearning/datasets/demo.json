They replaced the entire display because the screen was defective AND they replaced the logic board at the same time. \n \nBasically, that turned this into a brand new machine, except for the SSD and a couple very small dings on the corner.

BRAND NEW BOX. \n \n \n \nThe 85W MagSafe 2 Power Adapter features a magnetic DC connector so if someone should trip over it, the cord disconnects harmlessly and your MacBook Pro stays put safely. It also helps prevent fraying or weakening of the cables over time. In addition, the magnetic DC helps guide the plug into the system for a quick and secure connection. \n \nWhen the connection is secure, an LED located at the head of the DC connector lights up; an amber light lets you know that your notebook is charging, while a green light tells you that you have a full charge. An AC cord is provided with the adapter for maximum cord length, while the AC wall adapter (also provided) gives you an even easier and more compact way to travel. \n \nDesigned to be the perfect traveling companion, the adapter has a clever design which allows the DC cable to be wound neatly around itself for easy cable storage. \n \nThis power adapter recharges the lithium polymer battery while the system is off, on, or in sleep mode. It also powers the system if you choose to operate without a battery. \n \nCompatible with MacBook Pro with Retina display. \n    ","imageUrls":["https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_f53eUGIOJH0_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_fEGMzlwgryX_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_4b3XoVtAE4_600x450.jpg"],"postId":"5956272558","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/ele/5956272558.html","postDate":"2017-01-12T09:30:56-0800","updateDate":null,"attributes":"APPLE 85W MAGSAFE 2","locAccuracy":"high","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/ele/5956272558","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:47:09.463781","specs":{"condition":2,"Processor":[""],"Hard Drive":[""],"RAM":[""],"Graphics":[""],"Screen Size":[""],"Year":[""]},"processingStatus":"fresh","condition":2,"location":{"lat":37.3729,"lon":-121.856}}

{"title":"2012 15\" MacBook Pro with Retina Display for Sale! Comes with Extras!","price":700,"priceUnit":"$","cityName":"fairfield / vacaville","description":"\n         \nHello Craigslist, \n \nI have a 2012 15\" MacBook Pro for sale. Here's a quick list of the specifications for it: \n \n-MacOSX Sierra  \n-Retina display: 15.4-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit display with IPS technology; 2880-by-1800 resolution at 220 pixels per inch with support for millions of colors \n-2.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz) with 6MB shared L3 cache \n-8GB of 1600MHz DDR3L onboard memory \n-256GB Harddrive \n-Intel HD Graphics 4000 \n-NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M with 1GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching \n-MagSafe 2 power port \n-Two Thunderbolt ports (up to 10 Gbps) \n-Two USB 3 ports (up to 5 Gbps) \n-HDMI port \n-Headphone port \n-SDXC card slot \n-802.11n Wi-Fi wireless networking;3 IEEE 802.11a/b/g compatible \n-Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technology \n-Stereo speakers \n-Dual microphones \n-Full-size backlit keyboard with 78 (U.S.) or 79 (ISO) keys, including 12 function keys and 4 arrow keys (inverted \"T\" arrangement) with ambient light sensor \n-Multi-Touch trackpad for precise cursor control; supports inertial scrolling, pinch, rotate, swipe, three-finger swipe, four-finger swipe, tap, double-tap, and drag capabilities \n \nFor any other questions about the specifications, you can find them at the Apple page here: https://support.apple.com/kb/sp653?locale=en_US \n \nI have always kept the laptop in a hard shell case which will come with it. The hard shell case is a little beat up and due to some dust and other things getting in it, the bottom of the MacBook Pro does have some minor scratches on it. However, the inside and top of the MacBook Pro are perfect and show no signs of wear. I've only ever used the laptop for photography work and have just recently upgraded to a desktop so I'm looking to sell my Macbook Pro.  \n \nThe laptop comes with a brand new charger that was bought very recently for it. I also have the original box and manuals for it too. \n \nI'm asking $700 firm for everything and will not go any lower so please do not ask. I'm also not interested in any trades so again, please don't ask. \n \nI'm actually located in Sacramento, but for anyone coming from the Bay Area, I'm willing to meet in Vacaville, but no farther than that. And we'll meet at a local Starbucks so that you can test the wifi and anything else you'd like on it.  \n \nSo, If you've got $700 cash in hand and are willing to drive to me and meet in person, then please feel free to email me or, preferably, text me at 916-Eight-Three-Three-9530. Thanks and have a nice day!

I am no longer in the classroom and I am constantly on the go. I am unable to fit a 15 inch computer in my whitecoat pocket; as a father, I hardly have an opportunity to 'sit'. I hope to pass on this wonderful device to someone who will appreciate it as much as I do and will benifit from it more than I can.  \n \nI proudly say it isn't free of any blemishes as this laptop is too useful to keep in a closet untouched. There is one small indentation in the middle of the right speaker grille, peraps the laptops most vulnerable location to a falling frigerator magnet (couresey of my 2-year old son). The back right external corner also shows wear (multitidue of times entering and exiting my bag). \n \nThis is the very last Macbook Pro Retina prior to apple implementing the force touch trackpad. If you are familiar with apple products over the past 10 years, you already notice the absence of Steve Jobs. My Macbook Pro is his last design . My machine has an ethereal charm that is missing on the new force touch models. Perhaps it's sentimental, but see for yourself if you wish.

This is the current model in the lineup. \n \nWhat you might not know, is that KRANK is a local company. So whether you go to their headquarters or buy online, the best and longest costs big bucks. $449 to be specific. \n \nBest thing is, you don't need to be a pro long driver to benefit from a club designed to hit it longer and straighter.  \n \nShaft in this stick is a Fujikura Inertia 2 Tour. Flex is Stiff+, perfect for a good golfer, swing speed 95 to 105 mph. \n \nThis one I bought from a golf pro and has no visible marks on the face, crown or sole. Since I was recently in a car-totaling accident and will be a while before I get back to the links, I'm only looking to get back what I have in it. \n \nSo before you buy a Taylor Made, Callaway, Ping, Titleist, Nike, Cobra, Mizuno or anything else, check out this world beater.

There are some small runs and key issues mixed in there. \n \n[$2 Books] There are some magazines and a couple graphic novels as well. I have a bunch of signed books too. Original TMNT books signed by Kevin Eastman with COA. There are some TMNT magazines also signed and numbered by Eastman also with COA and a few other Image books signed by authors at comic shows. These are worth a lot more than this but they need to go so they are all being sold for $2 each. \n \nAll books are in great and collectible condition. I bought a bunch of them from a store that went out of business so they were flipped through and some do have some spine stress but nothing major. Just about all of them range from VF+ to NM or NM-. Of course there are some older books that are lower than that. I'm not a pro grader. \n    ","imageUrls":["https://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_aAPdyKty7xT_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_aQqxmYyGrak_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_aJVyJKlUZLF_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00S0S_17ny2gEHRuS_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00R0R_8aFTrs2STa3_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_d5IM3F5Kd0M_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_5zdpF1gvPhP_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_eiU1tHw224e_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01616_eJLUZ7KdjvG_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_hKz1wL8x1lV_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_lHFCVR1lQEn_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_grhxoOPREot_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_h687wza3ylT_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_lMCxWbQPAiQ_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_5wLBGBdFXrZ_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_gtMm7mWFYjw_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00202_dtxyoVjzcKS_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_2NMDjMo763O_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_4dZhm9ka3z2_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_E7A0AQevYl_600x450.jpg"],"postId":"5956722894","postingUrl":"http://phoenix.craigslist.org/nph/clt/5956722894.html","postDate":"2017-01-12T15:08:46-0700","updateDate":null,"attributes":"","locAccuracy":"highest","sellerUrl":"http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/clt/5956722894","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 08:07:15.741727","specs":{"condition":1,"Processor":["2 each"],"Hard Drive":[""],"RAM":[""],"Graphics":[""],"Screen Size":[""],"Year":[""]},"processingStatus":"fresh","condition":1,"location":{"lat":33.734547,"lon":-112.199979}}

Check quantities below, there are only a few left. Prices have also been lowered for a quick sale.** \n \nHello, I'm selling (20) of our Dell Latitude Intel Core 2 Duo business laptops that were used in a professional, clean environment - never personal use/etc. Latitude laptops are Dell's high-end enterprise grade machines and are built to last. These are all relatively low-use and in great condition. \n \nIntel Core 2 Duo processor (P8700 2.53ghz), 2GB of RAM, Intel HD graphics, wifi, fingerprint reader (on most), webcam, 15\" high resolution screens, VGA and DisplayPort video out, eSATA port, DVD RW, good batteries (a few have extended life batteries), power supplies included, and a clean installation of Windows 10 Professional already activated with Microsoft, upgraded properly from Windows 7 Pro. \n \nThese come installed with 128GB Samsung SSD (solid state) hard drives. The price is $160 for the SSD laptops; we can also upgrade the RAM before you come pick them up to 4GB for $10 more (while supplies last). This is recommended for Windows 10, you can easily upgrade the RAM yourself in the future - it's a very simple procedure on these. \n \n(4) Laptops with 128GB Samsung solid state drives remaining - $140 \n \nPriced for a quick private sale; I'm open to offers for purchasing multiple laptops or all at once. Please contact me by email at first with any questions or for my contact information. They have all been cleaned, updated, tested and are 100% ready to go. I'm located in NE Mesa, near the point on the map. Thanks! \n______________________________    ","imageUrls":["https://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_dNr1UI4bUSA_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00B0B_bzM6IifQxC3_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_9TAWXqfnDCq_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01111_c7ETXQs5Yo1_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_lEmiQLX8WJo_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_dQxWZYiGckV_600x450.jpg"],"postId":"5957337577","postingUrl":"http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/sys/5957337577.html","postDate":"2017-01-13T06:15:41-0700","updateDate":null,"attributes":"excellent Dell Latitude E6500","locAccuracy":"highest","sellerUrl":"http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/sys/5957337577","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 08:07:19.217016","specs":{"condition":1,"Hard Drive":["128GB","128GB"],"RAM":["4GB"],"Processor":[""],"Graphics":[""],"Screen Size":[""],"Year":[""]},"processingStatus":"fresh","condition":1,"location":{"lat":33.476717,"lon":-111.701313}}

{"title":"Massive 85L Backpack LOADED with BRAND NEW Camping Gear & Daypacks!!!","price":350,"priceUnit":"$","cityName":null,"description":"\n         \nMassive 85L Backpack LOADED with BRAND NEW Camping Gear & Daypacks!!!  \n \n> > > IS SPRING IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER? NO! IT'S HERE NOW!! < < < \n \n> > > FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED < < < > > > FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED < < < \n \n$ $ $ $ $ - - 1 OF 3, SOLD! ONLY 2 LEFT, NOW!! - - $ $ $ $ $  \n \n* * * NOTE * * *  \nWhereas I am firm on the pricing of the three \"large pack bundles\" and the remaining \"daypack bundles,\" my intent in selling these items is not only to recoup a (very) FEW bucks, but to also get rid of the inventory. Therefore, those who buy the already low-priced LARGE pack and Daypack bundles, I am more than willing to throw in a few extras of your choice -- and/or negotiate an even lower price on the extra item/s (provided they're still available). \n \nFor the purpose of full disclosure, over the years, I have sampled/tested several different brands and models of backpacks, in return for honest feedback regarding their functionality, size, weight and comfort, etc. Though I've never been paid to do this, I was obviously allowed to keep the backpacks regardless of the feedback. One of the companies was Outdoor Products (OP), though it \"was not\" the particular daypack I'm offering below. I've never sampled or accepted anything from Alps Mountaineering. Over three years ago, I chose the two backpacks offered below based solely upon their versatility, exceptional construction, price and 101 other reasons -- all based upon my first-hand experience in the field with them.  \n \nAlso see my listing for 12 expertly hand-painted, camouflaged 5-Gal Buckets and GAMMA SEAL Lids! \nhttp://phoenix.craigslist.org/cph/for/\n  \nhtml \n \nGreetings! \n \nA Little History: \nI am finally getting around to selling the remaining inventory I have from my little start-up business, \"The Dual-Survival Backpack,\" from several years ago. In 2012/13, I had the great idea of offering to the public, a backpack that was fully and completely equipped to go off the grid for between 3-6 days. The idea, I thought (and still do!!), was to have the well-equipped backpack available for people who were looking for a very solid pack -- be they beginning or experienced hikers -- either for just getting away for a few days for a fun-filled time with Mother Nature, or in the event of some kind of disaster/civil unrest/act of terrorism, etc., as a bugout bag.  \n \nAfter I sold several, I suffered two major back-to-back, untreated concussions, while . . . you guessed . . . hiking. Being propelled by a rock hidden in the tall grass, and falling forehead-first on a ground level boulder, just ain't good for ya! The first concussion of the \"two in five days,\" actually caused the second fall and concussion. \n \nAnyhoo, due to the lingering effects of those two concussions (and others, prior:), I found I no longer had what it took to run the business, and kind of closed up shop. Today, I still have some inventory left over that I would finally like to get rid of AT VERY LOW PRICES!! Every single item has been tested backwards and forwards, and I stand by everything to be the best you can buy for the money. And that's NOT to say that any element of these packs are cheaply made; they're NOT!  \n \nI don't have all the items that went into the original DSBP pack -- yet I'm not charging the original selling price of $1,100, either. However, the meat-and-potatoes are still in there. No food items are included in these packs.  \n \nEVERY ITEM OFFERED IS BRAND NEW! It \"may\" (and I mean MAY) have been used in a photo shoot or two, but never used! Each LARGE pack (see below); Brand New! * Sleeping bags; Brand New! * Day packs; Brand New! * Stoves; Brand New! * Sleeping bag mats; Brand New! *** ALL of the other items? BRAND NEW! *** Still, everything sold \"as is\" because of maybe a blemish or two on it??? But everything sold is in 110% working condition! \n  \n$ $ $ $ $ - - 1 of 3 LARGE PACKS ALREADY SOLD! ONLY 2 LEFT, NOW!! - - $ $ $ $ $  \n \nAs I said, I am selling the items in as many \"bundles\" as I can, thus I've broken down the sale three ways: \n \n1)\tLARGE Packs -- $350. ea. (see below) include all the items shown in the photos of that particular bundle. If you're just starting out, or you have a friend who needs a very well stocked, LARGE, long-haul backpack, you can't beat this for price and quality -- guaranteed!!! Were you thinking about trekking a LONG, multi-WEEK trail in one of our beautiful National Parks soon? This is your answer!! \n \nI spent literally weeks-at-a-time testing every part included it in my DSBP packs, making sure that those items that made the final cut, were up to a standard of quality that I was happy to stand behind. Everything that made up my DSBP packs was tested in every temperature and element Arizona has to offer, including four-days in a miserable wet snow storm in Flagstaff, several October days/nights in Utah and horrendous monsoon season thunderstorms, with all the high winds and downpours they can offer and temperatures as high as 105-degrees, during the summer. To this day, dollar-for-dollar, I would change only one or two things about it; THAT'S IT! \n  \n2)\tDaypacks -- $35. ea. is a STEAL! Do your research . . . I have 10 additional Daypacks that I am selling, and including for FREE, my own, personally made Wilderness First-Aid Kit, a $45. value! This homemade Kit has everything you need, and nothing you don't, for heading off-trail or hiking. As long as supplies last, I'm happy to throw in extras -- also at no additional charge -- such as bug spray, etc., and sell other items, if you're interested, at discounted prices (AS LONG AS SUPPLIES LAST). \n \n3)\tRemaining additional items sold singly, or in quantities (WHILE SUPPLIES LAST, Ssee below): \n_______________________________________________________ \n \nList of Items Bundled With LARGE Pack (ONLY! $350. ea):  \n- - 1 of 3 LARGE PACKS ALREADY SOLD! ONLY 2 LEFT, NOW!! - - \n \n*  Alps Mountaineering, Cascade 5200 (See the first two photos and list below for included items) \nThis is the best, simplest, most well constructed large -- or small -- backpack I've ever owned, and I've own/owned many backpacks! I've had my personal Cascade 5200 for over five years now, and have logged-in well over a thousand miles with this pack on my back (usually weighing in at least 45-50 lbs. fully loaded, with two, full, 3L hydration packs inside). With only three of these left, you might think I'd keep one for myself, but I'm not. My Cascade 5200 shows no signs of giving up -- even in the next five years!  \n \nThe capacity of this monster is 5200 cubic-inches, 85-liters. To give you an idea of its size, you can place a 2L bottle of soda in each SIDE pocket, with room to spare. The included fanny pack (which can also be used as a pack \"topper\"), could probably hold two, 2L bottles of soda, but it certainly holds one with much room to spare (See photos). Not that I condone carrying around 2L bottles of soda, just using them as a visual. \n  \nMore info can be found via the following link. Keep in mind my packs are \"olive green,\" and although they are brand new and unused, they do have a little patch of my company logo affixed to the front, as I used them in photo shoots. \nhttp://www.alpsmountaineering.com/products/packs/internal-frame-packs/cascade-5200 \n \n* * * THE FIRST PERSON TO PURCHASE ONE OF THESE BUNDLES WILL ALSO RECEIVE A PLATYPUS 3L RESERVOIR/BLADDER -- FREE! FREE! FREE! (Sorry, this unit was sold to a very happy buyer, yesterday! You still have a 2L reservoir that comes w/the below-listed Daypack and/or can purchase additional PLATYPUS 3L reservoirs online!) * * * \n \n*  2 L  Hydration Daypack; Outdoor Products, Ripcord  \n*  Tent; Hi-Tec V-Lite 1 (or V-Lite 2; a two-person version of the V-Lite 1 -- First come, first served on choice of tent size. I can make an argument for both. Contact me if your interested.) \n*  Sleeping Bag, Mummy; Suisse Sport, Alpine  \n*  Pad, Sleeping Bag; Stansport, Pack Lite \n*  Footprint; 6' x 8' Moisture Barrier for Tent, has many other uses \n* Wilderness First-Aid Kit; Handmade by myself based on years of experience and training in Wilderness First-Aid. Easily, a $45. value. I'll put my F-A Kit up against anybody's on the Net. Items included are too much for me to list -- see the photos or write me with any questions \n* Portable Water Filter; Frontier Pro Ultra-Light, Multi-Use \n* Stove Ware AND Stove \n*  Extra-Long Spoon; Super easy to clean. The only utensil I used/sold w/Mountainhouse Freeze-Dried Pouches incl in my packs \n*  Cup; Coleman, also used as a 1½-cup measuring cup \n*  Knee Pads; QEP Comfort Grip \n*  Gloves, Leather; Wells Lamont. Unless you want a different size than \"Large\" with your pack, please contact me ASAP, as I'm selling the others to the open public! (Other sizes include, 2 Extra-Large, 1 Medium, 6 Large) \n*  11-Function Multi-Tool w/Knife; Ozark Trail \n*  Folding Saw; Coleman  \n*  Folding Shovel; Coleman  \n*  Paracord; 50-100', 100 lb.   \n*  Bungee Cords; 1 each, Sm, Med, Lg \n*  Tent Stakes; 3x stronger than those included w/tent.

Your truck should look good, sound good, and be able to accelerate when needed!   \n \nTruck has 120k miles, which isn't much these days.  I run a auto repair shop, so all repairs done when with Ford OE parts only, no aftermarket crap.  All oil changes performed with Mobil 1 Synthetic with premium filters.  I can only imagine the anxiety of looking for a used vehicle, especially since most people are cheap and don't fix their vehicles when they should or use Auto Zone junk parts.   Cant tell you how many people don't fix their vehicles, because they are going to get rid of it!  Don't be the guy that buys someone else's problems!   If you are looking for a truck that has been professionally maintained, is in perfect condition, and already has all the bells and whistles, this is your truck!  I encourage you to drive it and have it inspected by your own shop!  Truck is in new condition, mechanically, inside and out!   \n \nI am the second owner, my co-worker was the original owner.

It is set up for a 200- 220 pound rider. the front fork springs have been replaced and shimmed for a larger rider. the rear dampener and spring, have been upgraded to a progressive suspension unit with a stronger spring. The tank has been upgraded to a acerbis 5.5 gallon desert tank with dual petcocks. It has pro taper bars with risers, and bark busters.  \nI did a top end rebuild a few hundred miles ago. New piston, piston rings, and valve  \nJob. I also replaced the timing chains and guides. \n \nThe sprocket have been changed to allow it to ride on the road easier. \nThe tire are dot approved knobbies. \nIt also has trail tech LCD display, but the speed sensor is not working at this time. \nThe exhaust is a super trapp IDS2. \nIt is registered and plated(no turn signals though). \nIt has a 130 w stator from the factory, so you can put a desert light on without a stator upgrade. \n \n \nThis bike is for tall people. Anyone under six foot will have very hard time with it. \nI know how hard it is to find a bike to suit taller/heavier people. \nIf you are of larger proportion, this should fit you much better than the others. \nthe title is notarized and ready to go! \n \n \nThanks for looking, \nI do not need help selling this bike! \nI would consider a trade for a working name brand(miller, Lincoln, etc.) tig and stick welder with argon bottle and accessories. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nxr Honda 600r 600 dirt bike motorcycle dual sport enduro klr bmw r1150 ktm  \nAdventure xr650r xr650l 650 500 off-road yz kx  \n \n    ","imageUrls":["https://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_8KPlsS1WTQN_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00606_6UidmS1yhzt_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01111_HDuudxa2Tf_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_h9E9BHylVSX_600x450.jpg"],"postId":"5939379603","postingUrl":"http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/mcy/5939379603.html","postDate":"2016-12-30T17:29:15-0700","updateDate":"2017-01-10T12:53:57-0700","attributes":"1988 honda xr600r good 600 gas white clean manual","locAccuracy":"medium","sellerUrl":"http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/mcy/5939379603","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 08:07:24.812433","specs":{"condition":1,"Processor":[""],"Hard Drive":[""],"RAM":[""],"Graphics":[""],"Screen Size":[""],"Year":[""]},"processingStatus":"fresh","condition":1,"location":{"lat":0,"lon":0}}

{"title":"1996 GMS Drums - 6 piece drum set - RARE AND AMAZING!!!","price":1750,"priceUnit":"$","cityName":"32nd st & Cactus","description":"\n         \nThis is a USA made GMS 6 piece drum set that I am selling.  It is a great looking and awesome sounding versatile kit!  With 4 toms you can really adjust to the style and genre of music you want to play. \n \nI am willing to sell with or without hardware - it all needs to go. \n \nGMS Drums are a boutique drum manufacturer from NY and make some amazing drums!  http://gmsdrums.com/ This is a kit built in 1996 that features maple shells with a white lacquer finish.  (see photo with stamp, they are all stamped but I didn't photo each one) \n1996 was the year they introduced their proprietary suspension mounting system as is featured on these drums. \nThese are without a doubt some of the best sounding drums I've had the chance to own \n \nSpecs: \n24\" Bass \n10\", 12\", 13\", 16\" Toms \n14\"x6\" Snare - matching maple \n \nTom heads are within a year old, never gigged with them and are Evans 360 2-ply heads, nice versatile sound, with a good balance of attack and resonance.  Snare has a Remo Controlled Sound coated head.  Drum kick head is an Evan Emad 2 with dampening ring (don't know the age) and the bass resonant head is the original with the GMS logo, the previous owner had put a piece of tape on a tear, doesn't affect the sound too much that I can tell but doesn't look the best either.    \n \nThe hardware is a bit of a mixed bag including Gibraltar hi hat (also a ludwig hi hat stand) (2) DW double braced boom/straight combo cymbal stands and a Tama single braced boom/straight combo cymbal stand, also a DW 5000 double chain single bass pedal.  There are a few misc. hardware pieces that I can include as welL. \n \nCymbals: \n14\" hi hat including ZHT Mastersound on top and Zildjian Aveidas on bottom. \n18\" A Custom Zildjian Crash \n20\" Sabian El Sabor Ride  \n14\" Sabian B8 Crash \n  \nThese drums are 21 years old and are in really great, but not perfect shape; however dollar for dollar these rival or top the likes or similar drum company's high end line of drums. There's not many of these being sold around the country, look around and you will see. \nI am open to offers, contact me to discuss more.

I bought it as a graduation present to myself for $1200 a couple years ago it was incredibly fast then and even faster now. \n \nThe lenovo x1 carbon is pretty much the perfect amount of machine.  It masterfully blends power and performance while not cutting many corners.  Here are the raw specs, they kind of tell most of the story: \n \nLenovo X1 Carbon, weighs 2 lbs 15 oz (see picture) \n \nIntel i5 2.5ghz multi core processor Hyper-Threading Technology, Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 3mb cache, integrated memory controller \n \n8GB 1333 MHz PC3-10600 Ram \n \n120 GB Solid State Disk Drive \n \nIntel HD Graphics 4000 \n \nFull size spill-resistant backlit keyboard \n \nButtonless touchpad (like a macbook pro) \n \nBluetooth 4.0, Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet \n \nMini DisplayPort, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, headphone/microphone combo jack \n \nFingerprint Scanner \n \nand all this is encased in a durable and impossibly light carbon fiber, magnesium-aluminum alloy frame. \n \nThis machine cost $1500 in 2012 and it's easy to see why. \n \n \nIf i had any complaints about this machine then it was merely  too few output ports.  Fret not, I got you covered, remember when I said total computing solution? \n \nSo I am including with this machine - A docking station/port replicator that will send outputs to three different displays (that's a lotta desktop) as well as add an additional. \n \nWhen you plug this dock into the lenovo you will instantly add the following ports to the Carbon X1 \n \n2 x USB 3.0 -- 1 provides always-on mobile device charging \n2 x USB 2.0 \n1 x DVI-D \n1x Gigabit Ethernet \n1x Stereo/Mic Combo Port \n \nSo in other words, you can leave a wireless mouse, wireless keyboard, a larger external display, a printer, and an external DVD drive plugged in to the stationary dock, and when you get home, plug the dock into your carbon and your home office springs to life.   \n \nIt's a pretty damn cool setup.  My price may seem high, but there's a reason for that.  I've done all the work for you, and am including several accessories.  this is ready to go. \n \nTHIS WILL ALSO COME WITH A FULLY ACTIVATED COPY OF MS OFFICE 2016 PROFESSIONAL PLUS & PHOTOSHOP CS6 PREINSTALLED ON THE COMPUTER.   \n \nComputer is Mint \n \nI have many other computers and parts for sale, to see the others click 'more ads by this user' to see the rest. \n \nAs with all my computers i offer a 'no questions asked'  refund within the first 15 days and a replace/repair warranty for the first 30. \n \nI am very easy to deal with, and i encourage you to ask me any questions you have about this or about laptops in general, this is my favorite topic. \n    ","imageUrls":["https://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_6MkmElPe4U1_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00303_61XrFgCaIgI_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_fGDx6c9PX3m_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_d2emWO8uWmK_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_38b4Fo8iaaR_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_b5VTv5XtIUe_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00W0W_fdVZAVa5ZV_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01313_9eAXftAHIY9_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00O0O_5QyptE4UVy5_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_cIIIBrdxKj0_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_cZGi3WULp91_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_3fylxcu7F1q_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00W0W_iRUyYKjvWMw_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_3n2ctOGgMSH_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01010_bR7E3yrRT7g_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01515_arppA0TL5Rq_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_fwJZNYVKx0f_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_aIZEYETHmN9_600x450.jpg"],"postId":"5913443037","postingUrl":"http://phoenix.craigslist.org/nph/sys/5913443037.html","postDate":"2016-12-10T07:41:35-0700","updateDate":"2017-01-06T21:39:30-0700","attributes":"like new lenovo x1 carbon 14\"","locAccuracy":"high","sellerUrl":"http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/sys/5913443037","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 08:07:26.811590","specs":{"condition":1,"RAM":["8GB"],"Hard Drive":["120 GB Solid State Disk Drive"],"Processor":[""],"Graphics":[""],"Screen Size":[""],"Year":[""]},"processingStatus":"fresh","condition":1,"location":{"lat":33.596541,"lon":-112.032604}}

I can also install any of these parts or combination of parts for a very fair price. I am not a dealer, just a garage guy that has accumalated a lot of parts over the years. \n  \nI still have many new/used Honda Trx 450r 450er 400ex 250ex parts, tires, wheels, and etc. Text or call me if you need something not listed. I probably have it, or may have a friend that does.  \n \n** I only have tires and wheels for the 400ex, nothing else for a 400ex. ** \n  \nAs I go thru the parts I will be adding pictures for the next few days.

Skat Trak Haulers on Douglas Blue Label wheels, ITP and other brands of sand tires. Text me for the specific tire you are looking for. \n  \nWhite powder coated PSR ATV jacks great for a quick change of tires, change the oils, lube the chain, or just to get the quad off of the ground to work on. They are pretty much universal and sell for about $70 a piece new. These haven't been used but a few times. Asking $75 for the pair. \n  \nCall or text is probably best, I never check my emails.

I bought it as a graduation present to myself for $1200 a couple years ago it was incredibly fast then and even faster now. \n \nThe lenovo x1 carbon is pretty much the perfect amount of machine.  It masterfully blends power and performance while not cutting many corners.  Here are the raw specs, they kind of tell most of the story: \n \nLenovo X1 Carbon, weighs 2 lbs 15 oz (see picture) \n \nIntel i5 2.5ghz multi core processor Hyper-Threading Technology, Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 3mb cache, integrated memory controller \n \n8GB 1333 MHz PC3-10600 Ram \n \n120 GB Solid State Disk Drive \n \nIntel HD Graphics 4000 \n \nFull size spill-resistant backlit keyboard \n \nButtonless touchpad (like a macbook pro) \n \nBluetooth 4.0, Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet \n \nMini DisplayPort, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, headphone/microphone combo jack \n \nFingerprint Scanner \n \nand all this is encased in a durable and impossibly light carbon fiber, magnesium-aluminum alloy frame. \n \nThis machine cost $1500 in 2012 and it's easy to see why. \n \n \nIf i had any complaints about this machine then it was merely  too few output ports.  Fret not, I got you covered, remember when I said total computing solution? \n \nSo I am including with this machine - A docking station/port replicator that will send outputs to three different displays (that's a lotta desktop) as well as add an additional. \n \nWhen you plug this dock into the lenovo you will instantly add the following ports to the Carbon X1 \n \n2 x USB 3.0 -- 1 provides always-on mobile device charging \n2 x USB 2.0 \n1 x DVI-D \n1x Gigabit Ethernet \n1x Stereo/Mic Combo Port \n \nSo in other words, you can leave a wireless mouse, wireless keyboard, a larger external display, a printer, and an external DVD drive plugged in to the stationary dock, and when you get home, plug the dock into your carbon and your home office springs to life.   \n \nIt's a pretty damn cool setup.  My price may seem high, but there's a reason for that.  I've done all the work for you, and am including several accessories.  this is ready to go. \n \nTHIS WILL ALSO COME WITH A FULLY ACTIVATED COPY OF MS OFFICE 2016 PROFESSIONAL PLUS & PHOTOSHOP CS6 PREINSTALLED ON THE COMPUTER.   \n \nComputer is Mint \n    ","imageUrls":["https://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_d2emWO8uWmK_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_fGDx6c9PX3m_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_6MkmElPe4U1_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_38b4Fo8iaaR_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00303_61XrFgCaIgI_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_b5VTv5XtIUe_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00W0W_fdVZAVa5ZV_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01313_9eAXftAHIY9_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00O0O_5QyptE4UVy5_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_cIIIBrdxKj0_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_cZGi3WULp91_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_3fylxcu7F1q_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00W0W_iRUyYKjvWMw_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_3n2ctOGgMSH_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01010_bR7E3yrRT7g_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01515_arppA0TL5Rq_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_fwJZNYVKx0f_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_aIZEYETHmN9_600x450.jpg"],"postId":"5914303007","postingUrl":"http://phoenix.craigslist.org/nph/sys/5914303007.html","postDate":"2016-12-10T17:57:29-0700","updateDate":"2017-01-09T11:15:20-0700","attributes":"like new lenovo x1 carbon 14\"","locAccuracy":"high","sellerUrl":"http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/sys/5914303007","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 08:07:29.739164","specs":{"condition":1,"RAM":["8GB"],"Hard Drive":["120 GB Solid State Disk Drive"],"Processor":[""],"Graphics":[""],"Screen Size":[""],"Year":[""]},"processingStatus":"fresh","condition":1,"location":{"lat":33.596541,"lon":-112.032604}}

Today, the price is still the same on Amazon: \n \nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HHEVL3C/ref=s9_al_bw_g267_i2 \n \nAs you might expect from an Apogee product - the sound quality is superb.  If you come over to purchase it, I can play you an electronic music track that I made where every single sound used was recorded with this mic (the song isn't released yet so I don't want to post a link here). \n \nAs the name suggests, it can record up to 96kHz sample rate.  And the great thing is that it's USB bus-powered.  So you can go on a road trip and have high-quality recordings simply by plugging it into your iPhone, iPad, (or laptop).   They also come with their own little desktop stands, but have a separate extension if you want to mount it onto a real mic stand (see pictures).  More info here: \n \nhttp://www.apogeedigital.com/products/mic \n \nBut, apart from the track I mentioned above, I have barely used them, and I'm realizing that I have too many mic's, and I can't afford to have so many. \n \nSo I'm parting with one or two of these Apogee mic's.   I'm selling one for $200 (which is about $50 less than what you would pay online), or two for $400 (which would be about $100 less than what you would pay online). \n \nPrice is firm - it's a great discount for a top-of-the-line brand product.  No low-ball offers please. \n \nSerious buyers only - cash only.

Featuring a 5 MP iSight camera with a backside illumination sensor, this Apple iPad will delight you with its exceptionally rich photos and the ability to take 1080p HD videos. The built-in Apple A5X chip with quad-core graphics powers the 3.1 million pixels contained in the 9.7-inch display and generates an unfaltering response for all sorts of operations on this Apple iPad. Your voice will be its command - the Dictation feature in the 3rd Generation Apple iPad types as you speak, be it e-mails or status updates on social networking sites.

Some main features are : \n \n-over 14,000 games for Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Colecovision, Sega Genesis/32x, Arcade/MAME, NeoGeo, Atari 2600/5200/7800, n64, and more \n-if it is connected to the internet then it can practically any movie/TV show/live events \n-play burnt/backup copies of Xbox games \n-other features as well \n \nhttp://chicagogamingmod.byethost7.com/original-xbox-modification/ \n \nQuestions and Answers: \n \n1) How long does the entire process take? \nA: I can have the entire job done and show you a demo on how to use all the main features within 30 minutes \n \n2) Do you need to bring anything besides the Xbox? \nA: YES, I will need you to bring the Xbox, and at least 1 working controller. I will have the cables and everything else \n \n3) where will we meet to get the service done?  \nA: I will meet you at a local business thats a very public/safe and relaxing atmosphere. The location will have everything we need to get the job done (tv, wifi, space, permission, etc)  \n \n4) will I come meet you?  \nA: I'm sorry but I can't do this for a number of reasons, main reason being due to the technical needs of the nature of the job I will need you to come to me \n \n5) do I do discounts for multiple services? \nA: YES! But, this is only discounted when services are done on the same visit (I mean no offense, but you'd be suprised how many people say \"give me a discount because I MIGHT refer you lol) \n \n6) Which other services do I do? \nA: I can modify the Wii, and Wiiu to do VERY similar things (no other systems tho currently, only original Xbox and Wii/WiiU) \nI can also do Kodi setups better than virtually anyone else in chicago. I have been on the Kodi/XBMC scene since its start in 2005(i'm not just some one who watched a youtube video on the topic lol) \n \n7) Will you get continued support in the future? \nA: YES!

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time. We fix dozens of these and have a very high success rate. \n \nSERVICES FOR GAME SYSTEM REPAIR,WE FIX PS4,XBOX ONE,PS3,XBOX 360,NINTENDO DS,WE FIX HDMI FOR ANY SYSTEM,IPHONE ,IPAD,MINI IPAD AND MORE,WE HAVE 15 YEARS WORKING WITH COMPUTERS AND SMALL ELECTRONICS WE ARE ARIZONA BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU ACCREDITED,IF YOU NEEDED HELP WITH YOU SYSTEM WE CAN HELP WE DO RE BALLING FOR ANY SYSTEM THANKS, SEE YOU SOON!!! \n \n**Playstation 4** \n \nBLOD,Instant Power Off - 65 \n \nHDMI Port Replacement - 40 \n \nBluetooth Failure - 50 \n \nBD Drive Replacement - 50 to 70 \n \nWLOD (HDMI Scaler chip) - 50 \n \n \n \n**XBOX ONE** \n \nInstant and Random Power off - 65 \n \nHDD Failure/error codes - 30 \n \nBD drive Issues - 50 to 75 \n \n \n \n**PS3** \n \nYLOD,RLOD,No video - 55 \n \nRSOD - 60 \n \nBD Drive not reading games - 40 to 65 \n \n \n \n**Xbox 360** \n \n(PHAT) RROD,E74,E73,No Video - 30 \n \n(PHAT) Open Tray Error - 30 \n \n(SLIM) REOD,No Video,Freezing - 30 \n \n(SLIM) Open Tray Error - 30 \n \n \n \n \nAll repairs come with a 90 Day warranty  \n  \n    ","imageUrls":[],"postId":"5944248354","postingUrl":"http://phoenix.craigslist.org/nph/vgd/5944248354.html","postDate":"2017-01-03T16:16:31-0700","updateDate":"2017-01-12T18:04:03-0700","attributes":"new blue ligth --hdmi port__ps4 dvd ps4 power problems_ps4 hdmi port ps4 hdmi port __ xbox one dvd","locAccuracy":"high","sellerUrl":"http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/vgd/5944248354","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:42:45.176076","specs":{"condition":1,"RAM":["PS3"],"Processor":[""],"Hard Drive":[""],"Graphics":[""],"Screen Size":[""],"Year":[""]},"processingStatus":"fresh","condition":1,"location":{"lat":33.563512,"lon":-112.117879}}

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable.

They are soldered onto the motherboard with 4 main pins with lots of solder, then they also have 19 very small pins that also have to be soldered onto solder pads on the motherboard. \n \nThe only good and permanent fix for a bad HDMI port is to replace the entire port. Some of them just have pins that have been pushed back so they no longer make contact with the pins on the cable. Even though many times you can push these pins back, there is no good way to keep them there. The whole port needs to be replaced in order to fix this permanently. \n \nWe offer an HDMI port fix that is reliable. We have the experience to repair your PS4 correctly and quickly the first time. We fix dozens of these and have a very high success rate. \n \nSERVICES FOR GAME SYSTEM REPAIR,WE FIX PS4,XBOX ONE,PS3,XBOX 360,NINTENDO DS,WE FIX HDMI FOR ANY SYSTEM,IPHONE ,IPAD,MINI IPAD AND MORE,WE HAVE 15 YEARS WORKING WITH COMPUTERS AND SMALL ELECTRONICS WE ARE ARIZONA BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU ACCREDITED,IF YOU NEEDED HELP WITH YOU SYSTEM WE CAN HELP WE DO RE BALLING FOR ANY SYSTEM THANKS, SEE YOU SOON!!! \n \n**Playstation 4** \n \nBLOD,Instant Power Off - 65 \n \nHDMI Port Replacement - 40 \n \nBluetooth Failure - 50 \n \nBD Drive Replacement - 50 to 70 \n \nWLOD (HDMI Scaler chip) - 50 \n \n \n \n**XBOX ONE** \n \nInstant and Random Power off - 65 \n \nHDD Failure/error codes - 30 \n \nBD drive Issues - 50 to 75 \n \n \n \n**PS3** \n \nYLOD,RLOD,No video - 55 \n \nRSOD - 60 \n \nBD Drive not reading games - 40 to 65 \n \n \n \n**Xbox 360** \n \n(PHAT) RROD,E74,E73,No Video - 30 \n \n(PHAT) Open Tray Error - 30 \n \n(SLIM) REOD,No Video,Freezing - 30 \n \n(SLIM) Open Tray Error - 30 \n \n \n \n \nAll repairs come with a 90 Day warranty    ","imageUrls":[],"postId":"5924468971","postingUrl":"http://phoenix.craigslist.org/nph/vgd/5924468971.html","postDate":"2016-12-18T12:26:40-0700","updateDate":"2017-01-11T09:54:08-0700","attributes":"","locAccuracy":"medium","sellerUrl":"http://phoenix.craigslist.org/reply/phx/vgd/5924468971","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:42:57.530334","specs":{"condition":1,"RAM":["PS3"],"Processor":[""],"Hard Drive":[""],"Graphics":[""],"Screen Size":[""],"Year":[""]},"processingStatus":"fresh","condition":1,"location":{"lat":0,"lon":0}}
